       "  'text': 'Words: Dan Hughes I get bored easily…as a human and as a\\xa0rider. — Kyle\\xa0Strait This sentiment, expressed by the man behind the dual slalom courses at the Life Time Sea Otter Classic presented by Continental, Kyle Strait, goes a long way to explaining the continued excitement and staying power of the discipline at Laguna Seca. From young racer to master builder, Strait’s cycling career has taken him around the globe, but always with a soft spot for Sea Otter. Originally from Southern California, Strait first encountered Sea Otter through the pages of mountain bike magazines. Inspired by what he saw, he asked his father if they could attend and, in 2000, got his first taste of the scale of a Sea Otter. You come up the hill to the guard shack and can see the whole place, the XC folks, the pits, and the hill where the dual slalom is…it’s\\xa0huge. — Kyle\\xa0Strait But the size of Sea Otter didn’t seem to deter Strait, and it didn’t take long for him to make his mark, winning the (adult) Pro Dirt Jumping competition at the age of 13. From there, Strait would become a fixture not only at Sea Otter but in the world of slopestyle riding, missing only two Sea Otters since 1999 (one when Sea Otter’s date was moved to the fall, and one when he was rehabbing a broken knee cap) and being the only rider invited to every edition of the Red Bull Rampage (and its first two-time champion). This connection to the sport is what helped Strait add course-building to his resume as a rider. After years of building tracks for himself and others, Strait got the call from Sea Otter to design the dual slalom courses in 2022. I had built lots of tracks as an amateur, but when I had the opportunity to carry on the legacy of Keith Defiebre (longtime Sea Otter dual slalom course designer) and work on the tracks at Laguna Seca, I, of course, said\\xa0‘yes.’ — Kyle\\xa0Strait But the work on the hillside wasn’t straightforward, both in terms of soil and the task at hand: You’ve got four different kinds of dirt to deal with there, and the weather. It’s also one of the only sports you can do where professionals at a high level and amateurs use the same course. You’ve got to design a course that’s challenging and safe for every\\xa0rider. — Kyle\\xa0Strait Strait’s process for course building is a time-intensive process. Starting 21 days out, he and his team build features from scratch with an eye towards accommodating riders of every stripe and incorporating features from favourite tracks around the world. For a pro, I might build three rollers that they can triple, but an amateur can roll, and I also want to take care of the adaptive racers, making sure the track is at least 39” wide. Sometimes, I think ‘that section from CrankWorx was awesome, let’s do\\xa0that. — Kyle\\xa0Strait And then comes the testing, which Strait does himself, although he has to employ a few tricks to approximate the feel for each rider group. I try to give myself as many handicaps as possible when I do the testing to get a sense of what it’ll feel like for a first-time rider. I’ll do the whole course seated, or with no brakes, or with my hands reversed to make sure it’s rideable for\\xa0everyone. — Kyle\\xa0Strait On race day, upwards of 600 athletes put the course through its paces with multiple practice runs, qualifiers, and the finals. Winners are crowned, and Strait takes photos to document the courses before they’re wiped away for another year. It’s a county park, so we return it to its natural state. That means we have to start from scratch at every Sea Otter, which is a challenge, but we craft unique courses every year and get different winners as well. If the 2024 course wasn’t what you like in dual slalom, then you’ll probably love the 2025\\xa0course. — Kyle\\xa0Strait In the end, Strait’s stewardship of the dual slalom event is about more than just one rider’s love of the sport; it’s a confirmation of the sport’s place in a score of riders’ histories. I remember sitting in the back of my dad’s truck, trying to warm up from the freezing rain, competing against riders years older than me in the 18-and-under category [in 2000]. Sea Otter has kept three generations of dual slalom riders going. I’m proud to be part of\\xa0that. — Kyle\\xa0Strait',\n",

       "  'text': \"Words: Cable Bay Enduro The Cable Bay Enduro and New Zealand Enduro MTB National Championships took place over the weekend at the Cable Bay Adventure Park in Nelson, offering riders three exhilarating days of practice and racing under perfect weather conditions. The event, now in its sixth edition, featured eight challenging stages spread across two days, with a half-day of practice and racing on Saturday, followed by a full day of competition on Sunday. Saturday's action commenced with shuttled practice sessions on the initial stages, allowing riders to familiarise themselves with the terrain before tackling the first three timed stages later in the day. The atmosphere was electric, with participants ranging from first-time racers to seasoned professionals, all eager to make their mark on the national championship course. For racing, riders were given a short shuttle before pedalling through some of Cable Bay Adventure Park's most lush terrain. Stage one for this year was The Poacher, a new trail which opened for last year’s event. The trail includes a big rock roll, which this year claimed a few riders who were pushing hard to beat the clock. Stage 2 was a short but punchy stage, which had been left with minimal catches after practice. It was a fine line between getting through unscathed and pushing too hard and blowing corners out, with some finding the limit. To finish day 1 of racing riders descended Veto and were met by over 300+ spectators, many of whom were dressed up with the hope of winning the Soundboks Go speaker that was up for grabs. Sunday's full day of racing encompassed five additional stages, each presenting its own set of technical challenges and demanding terrains. Riders navigated a cumulative elevation gain of approximately 1600 meters over 30 kilometres and over 2000 metres of descents. The well-maintained trails of Cable Bay Adventure Park, combined with the favourable weather, provided ideal racing conditions. However, as the day went on, the heat began to take its toll. The opening stage for Day 2 was a brand new trail which opened for the event. The trail, named The Courthouse, certainly served up some challenges as riders descended deep into the valley floor. The Courthouse was not only the longest descent of the weekend, but it included the steepest sections as well. Following stage 4, riders were on their own with no more shuttle assistance. Stage 5 was a park favourite CCR into Lost Time, followed by Stage 6, Broken Gnome, Stage 7, Missing Link into Jurassic, before tackling the final Stage 8, PineIine. Crossing the finish line, riders were handed a cold refreshment thanks to the team at Two Thumb Brewery before watching the remainder of the field tackle the stage. As times were confirmed, riders enjoyed more refreshments and a buffet meal to conclude an epic weekend of riding. With the sun still shining, the awards ceremony was one to remember as riders, sponsors and volunteers were celebrated for all their efforts. The winners of the Under 19 and Elite divisions were as follows: Elite Men: 1st Place: Brady Stone (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Joe Millington 3rd Place: Lachie Ross Elite Women: 1st Place: Xanthe Robb (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Winni Goldsbury 3rd Place: Zoe Trolove Under 19 Men: 1st Place: Eli Robertson (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Nico Schroder 3rd Place: Seppy Binsbergen Under 19 Women: 1st Place: Lucy Kemp (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Iley Nunns Full results here The Cable Bay Enduro continues to solidify its reputation as a premier event on New Zealand's mountain biking calendar, offering riders of all levels an opportunity to compete in a professionally organized and challenging environment. The success of this year's championships underscores the dedication of the organizers, volunteers, and sponsors in promoting the growth and recognition of Enduro mountain biking in New Zealand. For 2026, The Cable Bay Enduro will once more take place at Cable Bay Adventure Park and will certainly be an event not to miss as the organizers have some exciting plans taking shape. The reins for the National Championships, however, will be passed on to whom we have yet to find out! Photo credit thanks to Digby Shaw & Rory Stock\",\n",

You'll be double-dipping this track for sure! Boomslang is unlike any other trail in the park. With its raw, natural terrain, you can expect a track that evolves with every run. The ever-changing nature of the trail means no two runs will ever feel the same. From drops, jumps and root gaps to high-speed sections and creative line options, Boomslang is a challenge for all riders. If you remember how the top section of this trail evolved, this lower half will follow a similar journey. What starts off as deep loam will turn to a raw mudder through this winter. Then, as people ride it, new lines will open up and get rutted in, and more rock will appear. Prepare for a different feel every time you ride it. Boomslang can be found by traversing across towards the start of Pandoras Rocks, Fifty Shades and Terry’s Belly. The new start hill for Boomslang, giving you better speed for the flowier top section, is on the left as you pedal across. It heads down the steepest part of our hillside through thick woods, open off-camber sections with built-up gaps and big box features. Trail Highlights Type: Natural Tech Black Downhill Features: Drops, off-camber loam, berms, ruts, doubles, and flat-out speed sections Unique Appeal: Constantly evolving trail, raw and technical, offering a fresh challenge every ride. “We’re incredibly excited to launch the new bottom half of Boomslang. This trail is a game-changer—not just for us but for riders who crave the thrill of natural, technical terrain.

       "  'text': \"INTERVIEW Cam McCaul On Natural Selection Bike Words by Stephane Pelletier / Photos: Izzy Lidsky, Tyler Roemer Cam McCaul is a true legend of the sport. A rider who inspired thousands with his riding and energy, he continues to shape the sport as a pro rider, commentator, and all-around personality. Most recently, Cam's been deep in the development of Natural Selection Bike, Todd Barber's brainchild, and a real evolution from the Proving Grounds and Rampage formats we're used to. I got the chance to sit down with Cam and chat about Natural Selection, how it all came together, where it's headed, and what everyone can look forward to in tomorrow's broadcast. The live broadcast of NST Bike kicks off March 5th at 12 PM PST. In the meantime, enjoy Cam! Cam McCaul, Proving Grounds, Pacific City, Oregon. Natural Selection has been a groundbreaking event in snowboarding—how did the idea of bringing it to mountain biking first come about Cam McCaul: Todd Barber started “Proving Grounds,” which had the original mission of creating an event that could fill the gap between slopestyle and Rampage. In a nutshell, Proving Grounds caught the attention of Natural Selection as they were exploring the idea of expanding into other sports. If you think about it, there’s a common motivation there. NST was started by Travis Rice, looking to fill a gap in competitive snowboarding. Todd was doing a similar thing with mountain biking, and those paths converged. To be honest, I think NST is a great direction forward for all four sports that are involved (snowboarding, ski, surf, MTB), and I’m just so excited that mountain biking gets to be a part of it. What was your role in helping make this event a reality? Cam McCaul: If you really believe in something and you want to see it come to life, you’re just down to get in wherever you fit in. I initially fit in as someone Todd could brainstorm his ideas with during the Proving Grounds days. That evolved into wandering around the woods with Todd, Carson Storch, and Kyle Jameson trying to envision course designs for the original Proving Grounds in Prineville, Oregon, then I was creating content to promote that event, then I was test-riding some features, then I was the “Athlete Liaison” to kind of be the conduit between the athletes and the event crew, then I was the announcer for the event, then the host of the broadcast once it got to that stage, etc. Now that Proving Grounds has evolved into Natural Selection Bike, I’m working with the NST team in a lot of different ways to ensure we’re staying true to our sport, creating something that fills a void, helping with athlete selections, running the @naturalselectionbike Instagram account under the guidance of our NST social whizzes, announcing the event on-site, and I’ll be in the studio for the broadcast coming up March 5. How did you and the rest of the team go about choosing New Zealand as the location for the first-ever Natural Selection MTB event? Cam McCaul: New Zealand is not only full of great terrain and natural beauty but Queenstown, in particular, is also kind of THE SPOT for mountain biking during our northern hemisphere winters. I wasn’t on the scout trip when they chose the location, but if you watch the documentary “Search for Natural Selection Bike,” you can see how many different potential venues they explored before finally finding the right one. They seriously left no stone unturned in the search. It’s insane how dialled the venue at Mt. Dewar is for this event, first and foremost for the terrain, the pitch, the quality of dirt, etc., but also because Queenstown feels like the MTB epicentre this time of year. Everywhere you look, there are iconic zones, and the majority of the best riders in the world are passing through all season. Plus, the locals are some of the best people ever in addition to being some of the best riders/builders in the world. Cam McCaul, Proving Grounds, Pacific City, Oregon. What were the biggest challenges in adapting the Natural Selection concept to mountain biking? Cam McCaul: Well, the best part is, that’s not really the objective… It’s not a mission to create a snowboarding contest on mountain bikes. The mission is to create something new, unique and true to OUR SPORT. Each sport NST gets involved with has the creative freedom to structure its events to fill a needed gap in that individual sport. Coincidentally (or not), what this ends up creating is something that runs parallel with the riding that the athletes do on their own time and in their video parts. What kind of riding style and athlete mindset does this format reward compared to traditional freeride or slopestyle events? Cam McCaul: I’d say it really rewards riders who spend less time on the airbags and more time on the trails. Yes, you need tricks to do well, but maintaining flow and remembering speeds in order to link together a great top-to-bottom run really ended up being the most valuable skill a rider could bring to this event. I had this realization halfway through the week while watching practice – The riders who end up on the podium will be the ones who nail the best one-take segment in their contest run. How much usable footage for a segment can you produce in your comp run…? You gotta rip the trail sections, roost the berms, pop the hips, trick the drops, trick the jumps. The riders who drop runs that could be a film segment…those are the riders who will score high and place well. Sensai for the new generation. The terrain looked absolutely insane—what were some of the key elements that made this course unique? Cam McCaul: The top and middle of the venue are where the natural terrain features are on display. Making those natural features rideable and linking them together with singletrack and bike-park flow sections was a task that the build team executed beautifully. At the bottom, it opens up into really big jumps. The combination of the top, the middle, and the bottom is what makes this event unique. Linking a clean run through the whole thing is no easy task. How did the riders respond to the course? Were there any surprises in how they approached it? Cam McCaul: The runs are long, and the features are big. The first course walk day, all the riders hiked around and realized that learning these lines would be something that would take time. Each rider approached practice differently and had their own process. One rider’s approach that was insanely impressive (but not really surprising because he has done this before) was Dylan Stark. Dylan just wastes no time… He gets straight to the top of the course and does a T to B. Even if there are features that haven’t been guinnea’d yet, he just drops in and links a run. Natural Selection in snowboarding has a distinct judging format—how did you translate that into mountain biking? Cam McCaul: It’s called CREDO, which stands for Creativity, Risk, Execution, Difficulty, and Overall Impression. In all contests, I have a firm belief that the overall impression should matter most. It’s a nice idea, but in a lot of cases, it falls apart because most events have pre-determined point deductions for things like slipped pedals, crashes, etc. At NST Bike, you can literally crash and get back up, and if the merit of the things that are done successfully is heavy enough, it’s possible to bank a respectable score to build upon. In this event, there are two different trails, and the men’s riders take one run on each. So the men have a combined score for the two different runs, with no throw-aways. This format really rewards consistency. Max score for run 1 is 50 points, max score for run 2 is 50 points. The highest combined score (out of a possible 100) after those two runs takes the cake. In the spirit of having the flexibility to make adjustments as needed to ensure things are done right, the decision was made by the Women’s field to adjust their format from 2 runs to 1. Social media guy. Were there any specific moments that stood out to you as defining what this event is all about? Cam MCCaul: Absolutely… Finley Kirschenmann and Janelle Soukup. The timing of their trajectories as riders and how that converged with this event taking shape is super special. They both earned their invites through the “Dream Ticket” qualifying event and then absolutely killed it in their final runs at Mt. Dewar. This event is probably more suited toward veteran riders with long histories in the sport because the venue and format are so demanding. Yet, these two have already racked up well-rounded backgrounds and diverse skill sets at a very young age, and they put it all on display with pressure. They really do represent an exciting glimpse into the future. Some of the best freeride events have a strong storytelling element—how did you want this event to stand out in terms of visuals and coverage? I think from a “storytelling” perspective, the story is simple. Create a couple of the most fun and challenging feature-filled trails on earth, get some of the best riders to take one run on each of the trails, shoot it like it’s a film segment, and whoever kills it the most wins the event. When you’re riding with your friends, you know who’s ripping the hardest. This is just like that but elevated. There will be less controversy from viewers because there are fewer “apples to oranges” comparisons going on, and it will be easier for recreational mountain bikers to relate and enjoy watching. It’s not an anomaly…It’s mountain biking…at a very high level, yes…but it looks like mountain biking. Another thought, if you were to have a group of 10 riders ride one berm or one jump and then rank them 1-10 in order of who rode it best, it would be hard. Maybe you could easily determine who got first and who got last, but figuring out who placed 4th – 8th would be insane. The fact that these lines at NST Queenstown are long, and you’re being judged on two runs, creates more room for separation. It creates room for the strongest riders to rise to the surface but also more room for differentiation in the middle of the pack. Checking out the NST Track. This event seems to bridge the gap between backcountry freeride and competition—do you think it represents a new path for mountain biking? Cam McCaul: This event is one iteration of the many different paths it can potentially take in the future. No one location or terrain type defines mountain biking or the “freeride” side of mountain biking. If an event series is going to truly represent freeride mountain biking, the event series needs to be as versatile as the sport itself and able to experiment and evolve. Instead of saying it represents a “new path” for mountain biking, I’d say it represents a whole new “trail network” of possibilities. Could you see Natural Selection growing into a multi-stop series like in snowboarding? If so, where would you love to see future events held? Cam McCaul: Heck yeah. I think each location that becomes home for future events will also dictate what type of format the event takes on, what riders get invited, etc. This Queenstown event is held on really challenging trails/jump lines, like Coronet Peak on steroids. Another event could be held in a desert zone with chutes, fade-aways, and cliff drops. There could be another event in the woods with wild freeride stunts connected by trail sections. Let your imagination run wild with the things that you love about mountain biking, and create a contest for it. That is what this is for. How do you think this format challenges riders differently than Rampage or the Fest Series? Cam McCaul: Rampage is a one-of-a-kind spectacle and is untouchable in terms of the box that it checks. Fest is a series of all-time jam sessions on huge jumps. Freeride can’t be put into a box, so it makes more sense to have a lot of different boxes and figure out the right ways to check them. Cam McCaul, Proving Grounds, Pacific City, Oregon. What impact do you think this event could have on the next generation of freeriders? Cam McCaul: Riders will develop really well-rounded skill sets. What’s something about organizing an event like this that people watching at home might not realize? Cam McCaul: Todd would be the right one to answer this in more detail, but from my perspective, it’s the village of passionate and dedicated people working around the clock to make wildly ambitious ideas possible. From Todd’s H5 Events to All Good Productions in NZ, to Rod Drury’s TRAC non-profit, the NZ Government’s tourism initiatives, the course builders at Elevate, the athlete advisory committee we have that consists of Cam Zink, Carson Storch, Casey Brown, and Emil Johansson, plus the whole crew I work with at Natural Selection who are simultaneously running events in 4 sports in the first 3 months of the year, it’s absolutely incredible what’s possible when you all feel like you’re doing it for the right reasons. I don’t think it’s possible to understand how much is going on behind the scenes until you get a peek behind the curtain. Were there any “oh sh*t” moments during planning where you thought something might not come together? Cam McCaul: For me, the biggest “oh shit” is realizing how many qualified athletes there are in our scene right now but how few spots there were on the invite list. That was the hardest part for me to be involved with. I’ve sworn I would never judge an event, but here I am on a panel of people who are selecting the invited riders, knowing that there are inevitably going to be so many I want there that won’t make it on the list. Being on a selection committee is almost worse than being a judge. Guess that’s what I get. If you could pick one rider from any era of MTB history to drop into this event, who would it be and why? Cam McCaul: Any era? Ok, Kirt Voreis circa 1999. Because he rules and always has. Some of the Natural Selection Bike Crew.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"MCGAZZA DREAM JAM 2025 Words and Photography // Riley McLay One of the hallmark events of the New Zealand summer has arrived, the McGazza Dream Jam. The highly anticipated event draws not only local riders but also a wave of overseas athletes who call Queenstown home during the off-season. It’s a continued celebration of Kelly McGarry’s enduring legacy that has inspired many riders of all ages to ride more and push their own progression. The idea of the McGazza Festival as a whole is to live a weekend like Kelly lived his life. Ride what he liked to ride, listen to the music he liked, and make the most of every moment just like he did. Whether you know of Kelly or not, the weekend gives riders the platform to elevate their skills and to learn from some of the best riders in the world while still keeping to Kelly’s relaxed outlook on life. The McGazza Dream Jam is a showcase of the culture that Kelly embodied and inspired. This year’s addition of an under 19’s category to open for the main event allowed the highly talented and up-and-coming groms to showcase what the future holds for the sport. The crowd was also treated to a star-studded main event with the likes of Jackson Goldstone, Laurie Greenland, and Asa Vermette. Not to mention, Kiwi free-riders Conor Mcfarlane and Robin Goomes were also throwing down. Next year marks 10 years since Kelly’s passing, and event organizers are already gearing up for a big one! A full trip down memory lane to showcase why Kelly is still such a special part of this community. Mcgazza Forever! Kelly still really inspires me. His attitude toward life and his willingness to help others and have the best time doing it makes me want to keep running this event for as long as\\xa0possible. — Emmerson\\xa0Wilken Celebrating the legacy of Kelly McGarry. Inspiring to see the next generation following in Kelly's legacy. Noah Evens boosting to the moon! Camden Rutherfurd showing that he is one of the most stylish up-and-coming riders. While having as much fun in the process. Imagine growing up with Dream Track in your backyard. Local ripper Reece Everett is no stranger to Dream Track. Throwing huge whips at only 14 years old. Watch the space, the groms are coming! A quick refresh before the adult's session. Jim Monro firing out of the gate. Jacob O'Donoghue-Price floating over the line up of riders. Tyler Brooker shining in all white. Asa Vermette in the house. Robin Goomes' huge backflip had the crowd on their feet. Conor Macfarlane with a head-turning dumped 360. You just can't teach style. Asa in full control. Rudi Eichhorn with one of the biggest backflips of the night. Gareth Burgess likes what he sees. Billy Spurway's trademark steeze. No complaints here. Flame on! Fritz fulling dumped, followed this up with a backflip Superman! Win some, lose most. Ollie Clements took a set of heavy bails throughout the night but kept getting back up and into his work. A quick Red Bull sales meeting as Asa and Jackson wait for their next run. Big ups to the Queenstown Mountain Bike Club and the Kelly Mcgarry Foundation for always putting on such a dialled event. Volunteers always bring the stoke. Plent of mouths to feed. Laurie Greenland with a steezy one-footer. Vinny Armstrong is very much a crowd favourite. There is always a chainsaw. Big smiles all round. Conor leading out the final McGazza train to end the night. McGazza Forever.\",\n",

Registrants will receive a shuttle service on Friday, a t-shirt, sticker, an aid station on the course Saturday, a family dinner post-ride and complimentary beverages on Friday and Saturday night. Registration cost is $100 Until March 1st, at which point it will go up to $120 Register Here Route: 43-mile or 22-mile loop on some of the best trails on Earth. A mix of machine-built flow trails, rocky old school tight single track, double track and gravel roads. Ride fast or take it slow; all options are valid. This is an event for experienced mountain bikers. It's not overly technically hard, but there are some challenging sections, and it's a really big day on the bike. Registration can be used for either distance, feel free to make the call day of. New this year are two options for the short course. Riders can ride the first half of the long route, which has more climbing and technical challenges, or start the course from the halfway aid station and meet up with their friends doing the longer route. The second half of the course has fewer climbing and technical features than the first half and is more suitable for newer riders. Ride the most beautiful single track in the Midwest Gear: We recommend a full-suspension mountain bike or hardtail. Most folks opt for a 130-150mm travel range bike. The course is mostly a blue trail, but the first half has one black section, although the harder bits are easily walkable. You'll need to be self-sufficient out there and be prepared to rescue yourself, as there is no cell service. Bring tools, tubes, tire plugs, spare derailleur hanger, etc. We also suggest riders bring ample water and food. If you'd like to rent a bike, the Keeweenaw Adventure Center in town has plenty of options. Schedule Friday - Riders Arrive Check-in at Trails End Campground 11-4 pm Shuttle Service 4-8 pm - Keeweenaw Adventure Company Sunset Ride: 8:30 pm From Trail's End to Top of Flow - bring lights and beverages Saturday Check-In 8-9 am Mandatory Riders Meeting 8:45 am Rollout 9 am Aid Station Open from 11-4 pm 6 pm Time Cutoff Saturday 7-10 pm - Dinner, Bonfire, Beverages, Music, Revelry About Copper Harbor - One of our favourite places to visit in the world, and we can't wait to share it with you.

       "  'text': \"Haf Land and Fleur TK's North Wales Adventure Video by Samantha Saskia Dugon Photos by Sophie Skelton I'm Hâf Land, and I ride for Starling Cycles. I joined the family just over a year ago as a racer, and for 2025 I'm mixing this up a bit. Rather than competing, I'm going to focus on some adventures - big rides, fun stuff, and making some content. I'm excited! To get started, Fleur and I caught up for a local adventure in North Wales. She's a fellow Starling rider and one you've probably seen here in this video . We met up with filmmaker Samantha Saskia Dugon and also Sophie Skelton, who was capturing the day in pictures. The plan was to head out for the day and explore some of my local trails around Llanberis, in North Wales. I moved back here from Scotland a little while ago and have been really loving getting to know the place again, and wanted to show Fleur round. It was the perfect opportunity to shoot a video. We met bright and early (10 am!) and everyone was just super friendly. We all just got on great from the word go, which was a great start. We started off at a café to grab some coffee from a lovely yellow shop on the high street that matched Fleur’s bike! No coffee for me though - I’m Gen Z, so I don’t need it, according to Fleur, who is a Millennial and drinks a flat white. We set off up the hill with big smiles on our faces and butterflies in my tummy because I didn’t want anything to go wrong! We had an amazing time shooting this little project, and it was so great to have an all-female creative team—so much stoke! Sam was incredible and so well-organised with her filming, making the day stress-free and fun for all of us. Sophie recently moved up to Mid Wales and came along to take photos as she is developing different skills and techniques to use in her photography. Seeing her and Sam bouncing ideas off one another was so cool. Fleur is always absolutely awesome and drove all the way from Scotland that same morning just to see me! We filmed the day over four separate tracks and did a lot of pushing up through brash, which was less fun. But we ended up with some awesome footage and newfound inspiration for riding again. 2024 was a funny one for me, I started out racing really well, but had a bad-luck accident where I dropped a bike on my head and struggled with a concussion for months. I found it hard to be excited or inspired about riding for so long - but this adventure really brought back my love for riding. I had the best day and felt so at ease in the company of these three amazing women. As I’m sure we will see in the video, Fleur and I had a few tumbles! It was mostly on the same section of track, straight into the bushes! By some power of the universe, despite the high ratio of crashing to not crashing, Fleur, myself, and our bikes came out unscathed, bar a few scratches and a lot of laughter! No broken brake levers, PHEW! The trails in the area, although not many in number, rate very highly in my books. With some amazing craftsmanship on display, it’s clear that a lot of time and effort has gone into these tracks, and we were so grateful to be given permission to film there. The scenery was incredible, and we got so incredibly lucky with the weather—it was dreamy! After a long day of filming and dilly-dallying, we were so ready for another café break before calling it a day. We headed to an amazing local spot at the end of the lake, which I had been hyping up all day. We were all so ready for some nice hot food and drove there, only to find out it was closed. DEVASTATING. By this point, we were hanging. We were out of snacks, and just about keeping our eyes open. We called it quits and headed back to the café we had visited in the morning. We had something to drink and some cake (as all the hot food had sold out), then made our way back to the car park. After a long day of grafting, with three out of four of us having long drives back to various parts of the UK, we called it a day and headed home. And what a day it was! I’m super grateful to have been given this opportunity. I hope you all enjoy watching it! Expect to see more of this soon! CREDITS: This project was produced by an all-female crew.

The energy in the crowd was electric, especially as Kiwi athletes took to the track in this chainless head-to-head showdown. No stranger to the Crankworx World Tour Jackson Frew won his first ever Pump Track gold medal, while his female counterpart Laura Smulders is a brand-new face to the Crankworx family. As Round 2 of the 2025 Crankworx Pump Track Series, the stakes were high, with riders pushing their limits on the technical and fast course. In the women’s final, Dutch racers Manon Veenstra and Laura Smulders battled to the wire. Smulders edged out her fellow Dutchie Veenstra in a nail-biting finish, winning gold by just 0.007 seconds. The small final saw New Zealand’s Sacha Earnest go head-to-head against reigning Pump Track World Champion and winner of the Crankworx Summer Series Christchurch Pump Track event, Sabina Košárková of the Czech Republic. Košárková took the bronze, cementing her leading position in the 2025 Pump Track Series standings. On the men’s side, Jackson Frew, the 2024 King of Crankworx runner-up, clinched his first-ever Crankworx Pump Track gold medal. The Australian racer delivered a flawless performance in the finals, outpacing local hero and former King of Crankworx Tuhoto-Ariki Pene. Despite clocking the fastest run of the event earlier in the night, Pene finished 0.067 seconds behind Frew in the finals, settling for silver. The bronze medal match featured Kiwi speedster Tyler Waite and Aussie Bailey Meares, who was returning to competition after an extended injury break last year. Meares managed to edge out Waite by +0.106 seconds in a nail-biting second run. A significant upset came in the quarterfinals when Australian rider Ryan Gilchrist, the defending King of Crankworx and winner of Round 1 of the 2025 Pump Track Series, crashed out, allowing his teammate Tyler Waite to advance.

       "  'text': 'Crankworx Rotorua 2025 wrapped up with high-speed head-to-head action at the Specialized Dual Slalom, as athletes tackled a brand-new, repurposed Speed & Style course at Skyline Rotorua. The challenging terrain and uncertain bike choice made for an intense day of racing, pushing riders to their limits. Caroline Buchanan Takes Gold Over Jordy Scott In the women’s final, former Queen of Crankworx, Caroline Buchanan faced Jordy Scott in a dramatic battle. Scott held a 0.237-second advantage going into the second run, but Buchanan’s acceleration in the final flat section proved too strong, allowing her to clinch victory. Adding to her remarkable win, Buchanan was forced to race on an unfamiliar bike after her Dual Slalom bike was stolen just a week before arriving in Rotorua. “This course was so technical. Shark fin features that really threw a different element to the racing today”, Caroline Buchanan about the new course. The small final saw Pump Track Champion Sabina Košárková grab her second bronze medal of the festival, after also finishing third in the Pump Track Challenge earlier this week. In her first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom, Košárková defeated young Canadian Slopestyle standout Natasha Miller, who slipped on the final left-hand berm, sealing Košárková’s podium spot. Women’s Top 5: 1. Caroline Buchanan (AUS) 2. Jordy Scott (USA) 3. Sabina Košárková (CZE) 4. Natasha Miller (CAN) 5. Laura Smulders (NED) Ryan Gilchrist Defends 2024 Victory In a nail-biting gold medal battle against Sam Blenkinsop, Ryan Gilchrist emerged victorious despite a tricky first run where he nearly missed the final gates. Gilchrist came back strong, laying down the fastest time of the day at 19.961 seconds - a significant gap over the second-fastest run by Tuhoto-Ariki Pene (20.305s). With this, he secured back-to-back victories in Rotorua, defending his 2024 Specialized Dual Slalom gold and once again displayed his prowess and pedal power. Kiwi rider Sam Blenkinsop showcased that after several years of racing within the Crankworx circuit, he is still a force to be reckoned with and not to be counted out of the battle for the 2025 crown. In the bronze medal match, Gilchrist’s YETI teammate Richie Rude faced off against local hero and 2023 King of Crankworx, Tuhoto-Ariki Pene. Pene, in a dramatic turn, missed the final gates and was disqualified, awarding Rude with a bronze medal in his first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom. Men’s Podium: 1. Ryan Gilchrist (AUS) 2. Sam Blenkinsop (NZL) 3. Richie Rude (USA) 4. Tuhoto-Ariki Pene (NZL) 5. Tegan Cruz (CAN) Full results here .

       "  'text': 'Full event replay Words: Crankworx The Maxxis Slopestyle in Memory of McGazza, the opening event of the Crankworx FMBA Slopestyle World Championship (SWC), delivered an electrifying showcase of progression and high-stakes competition under clear and calm skies. Originally scheduled for Sunday, the event was moved to this morning due to strong winds in the forecast. After extensive consultations and careful consideration of multiple scenarios, athletes unanimously opted for an electrifying new competition format: a high-stakes two-run elimination battle. This strategic shift not only raised the intensity but also gave all riders the opportunity to perform on the big stage of the SWC. For the men, the field was cut in half after Run 1, while the women’s competition saw the top five of eight riders advancing to a second round. Women’s Competition: A New Era Continues Now in only its second season within the Crankworx FMBA Slopestyle World Championship, the women’s competition reinforced that these athletes are pushing the limits and proving they belong on the world’s biggest stage. Germany’s Patricia Druwen made a powerful comeback from illness, throwing down an incredible 87.75-point run filled with technical mastery and precision. Her trick list included an X-Up to Suicide No Hander, a Double Oppo Bar Spin, and a Backflip Tuck No Hander, solidifying her place as a serious title contender this season. Joining Druwen in the final five were Natasha Miller, Robin Goomes, Shealen Reno, and Zoe Witwicki. Meanwhile, Renata Wiese and Natalia Niedzwiedz, competing in their first-ever SWC event, struggled with speed on the course and were eliminated after Run 1. The final runs saw Zoe Witwicki better her score but fall short of catching 2023 SWC Champion Shealen Reno, finishing fourth after missing speed into the whale tail. Meanwhile, Druwen, Miller, and Goomes celebrated their podium positions with a stylish party train down the course. Women’s Results: 1. Patricia Druwen (GER) – 87.75 pts 2. Natasha Miller (CAN) – 80.50 pts 3. Robin Goomes (NZL) – 75.25 pts 4. Shealen Reno (USA) – 67.50 pts 5. Zoe Witwicki (CAN) – 61.25 pts 6. Renata Wiese (CHI) – 35 pts 7 Natalia Niedzwiedz (POL) – 19 pts Men’s Competition: Tim Bringer Finally Takes Gold After eight podium finishes in the SWC, France’s Tim Bringer finally claimed his first-ever Crankworx FMBA Slopestyle World Championship victory, dominating the field with a 93.25-point run that left his competitors in the dust. Dropping in last, his 360 Double Tailwhip to Bar Spin, Double Backflip Tuck No Hander, and 360 Tuck No Hander In-Double Backflip Out solidified his spot at the top – an untouchable lead that no one could surpass in Run 2. The 2024 Red Bull Rookie of the Year, Kaidan Ingersoll (USA), proved his rising star status, bettering his score in Run 2 to secure silver with 90.87 points. Meanwhile, Canadian Ben Thompson, a last-minute entry after injuries in the field, made an immediate impact, earning bronze with an 82.92-point first run. The final round saw Paul Couderc, Griffin Paulson, Jake Atkinson, and Max Fredriksson advance, though Paulson, Atkinson, and Fredriksson all crashed on the final feature, much to the crowd’s amazement. Men’s Top 8 Results: 1. Tim Bringer (FRA) – 93.25 pts 2. Kaidan Ingersoll (USA) – 90.87 pts 3. Ben Thompson (CAN) – 82.92 pts 4. Paul Couderc (FRA) – 82.06 pts 5. Chance Moore (CAN) – 81.25 pts 6. Griffin Paulson (CAN) – 80.42 pts 7. Jake Atkinson (GBR) – 79.25 pts 8. Max Fredriksson (SWE) – 78.92 pts Full results here . What’s Next? The 2025 Maxxis Slopestyle in Memory of McGazza set the tone for an explosive season ahead, proving that both the men’s and women’s competitions are more competitive than ever. With the RockShox Kārearea Downhill already underway on a brand-new course at Skyline Rotorua, the action is far from over. Tune in for live coverage on Red Bull TV at 3:15 PM NZDT. And with the Specialized Dual Slalom wrapping up the Crankworx Rotorua festival tomorrow, fans can expect even more high-speed action before the tour moves on to the next stop. >>Full Results >>Schedule >>Broadcast Replay',\n",

       "  'text': \"Behold, the visions of the seer. More radial tires. Schwalbe beat the competition to the punch with their radial tire release, but I don't think things will settle with that first release. The concept has legs, and the ride quality the tires offer seems to impress everyone that has a chance to ride them. As far as I understand it, the concept isn’t under patent protection, and can be iterated with various thread counts and casing approaches beyond the basic orientation change. I for one am stoked to see what the rubber wizards do with the idea over the next year or two. More downhill bikes. I think we’re going to see a few brands that historically haven’t offered a standalone downhill bike come to market with race bikes. My reasoning for this guess is as such: The DH World Cup is aiming to be a more premier and “important” series, with participants theoretically getting focused screen time and consistent results. That should encourage any brand with assets to spend to consider entering the ring, and offering their own ride for athletes to showcase. Add to that the supposedly democratized Continental series that the UCI has announced, and you’ll have a burgeoning market of aspiring racers looking for a solid race bike. DH bikes have never been a massive market, and of late if feels like most people are gravitating towards pedal-friendly machines, but this revised take on professional racing could stoke some competition on the brand end. Stronger brakes. The SRAM Mavens are the most powerful commonly available brakes on the market at this point, by some margin. Raw power isn’t the end-all be-all, but a high bar has been set for that one parameter, so I’d venture a guess that we’ll see more attempts at that accolade. Whether or not this is something you’re on the hunt for, I think the benefits come to light once you’ve had the chance to try something that can fundamentally change the way you approach braking, opening up new lines and speeds. Integrated complication. Last year I staked my claim on user-changeable frame stiffness being an increasingly common element on production bikes. While that didn’t catch on quite yet, I still think that’s on deck. I may be recycling from last year's list, but I still feel this one coming, so here's it is again.\",\n",

Words by Holly Krasnuik and Darren Burns Photos by Jake Paddon and Natalie Carriere Video by Aedan Skinner What began years ago as a casual campfire chat between Canadian pro DH athletes McKay Vezina and Mark Wallace has now become a reality: Canada’s first-ever Downhill Mountain Bike Combine. The Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society in partnership with Stereo Racing hosted the first annual Downhill Mountain Bike Racing Combine Invitational on Mount Prevost in Duncan BC on November 1-3, 2024. Combines are a traditional method for teams and sports to find and develop new talent; which tests athletic skills such as speed, power, strength (mental and physical) and agility to identify future top players for the sport. The goal was to facilitate an event that would connect industry and unsigned U15-U17 Canadian riders in a meaningful, personal way that would result in a first hand learning experience about racing on the World Cup circuit. Parent participation was an integral portion of the event as we wanted to help facilitate an experience for supporting family members that helped garner awareness about the realistic expectations of what a professional career for their children encompasses. This year’s participants were 13 of BC’s fastest riders between the ages of 14 and 16 who have a goal of one day competing in the World Cup Circuit. These athletes were invited due to their performance at the 2024 BC/Canada Cups. The weekends events included: Friday: Meet and greet. Pro rider led Course inspection. Saturday: closed course practice on a taped course with 12 marshals on Mt.Prevost “Race Trail” Saturday evening: Q&A Panel with 8x industry professionals including UCI Team managers, nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist, Performance coach and pro athletes. Sunday: Timed training and race run It was great to see how excited the riders and their families were to be there this weekend. It shows the value of what we are trying to do and already has us thinking about next\\xa0year! — Mark\\xa0Wallace Working with Holly and Mark on the Prevost Combine was a real privilege. As a trail society, being able to provide a platform and a trail for an event like this to take place is extremely rewarding. Our hope is that the Prevost Combine created a stepping stone for these extremely talented and dedicated kids to be able to take their riding careers to the next level. It was a pleasure connecting with the participants, their families, and all the volunteers that contributed time to this unique\\xa0event. — Lorrie Mansey, CTSS Executive\\xa0Director About the organizers: The Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society was founded and incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 2013 and currently builds, maintains and advocates for excellent mountain biking and hiking trails in the Cowichan Valley; namely on Mt Prevost, Mt Tzouhalem, and Maple Mountain. With more than a decade of industry experience, Stereo Racing is dedicated to coming up with creative solutions to amplify and enhance the meaningful impact and sustainable development of mountain biking both locally and globally.  We are committed to cultivating a pathway for Canadian athletes, nurturing their talent, and fostering a culture that embodies the heart of mountain bike culture in Canada. We strive to empower our team members by instilling values of perseverance, resilience, dedication, and self-respect, to not only excel in racing but also in life.

       "  'text': 'BIKE CHECK Lean Cycles P1 Prototype Photography by TEBP In the beginning there was beer. Beer, bikes, two friends who were studying mechanical engineering and the will to design a bike unrestricted from commercial market demands. Robert and Luca were at the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW) when they had the idea to build a bike based on everything they had learned at university and their previous jobs. Luckily, their tutor was a bike nerd too and allowed Luca to make this bike his master\\'s thesis. The Lean Cycles P1 prototype is a wild mix of 3D printed steel parts, machined aluminum, welding, brazing, a progressive high pivot suspension design and - last but not least - a belt-driven gearbox. Robert and Luca founded a small company which enabled them to apply for research funding from Innosuisse. Their friend Kilian joined them later in the process, so Lean Cycles is now a team of three friends. From the beginning, they always wanted to create a bike with a very light rear end to reduce the unsprung mass. At the same time, a high progression suspension design was on the list too, which was designed around a coil shock. Thanks to the massive uni-piece swingarm, they don\\'t need a frame splitter to install the Gates belt. The geometry is full custom of course: - Reach: 480 mm - Stack: 635 mm - Wheelbase: 1272 mm - Seat angle: 77.5° - Head angle: 63° - Chain stays: 445 mm - BB height: 345 mm The goal was to push the boundaries of frame design to a new level using modern development and manufacturing processes, without being driven by commercial market\\xa0demands. — Luca from Lean\\xa0Cycles The tubing is Reynolds 931. Luca says that it\\'s really good for joining processes and double butted. It\\'s the same material as the 3D printed parts, which is needed to get the best results in his opinion. The machined swingarm is made from rather rare 2099 aluminum. Luca says that it contains quite a lot of copper and lithium, which makes it stiffer and even lighter than other aluminum alloys. It\\'s so rare that he had to get some help from his tutor to source it. It\\'s also around 10x more expensive than other alloys, so it wouldn\\'t be a viable option for a serial production bike. As this was a master\\'s thesis at a Swiss university, it wouldn\\'t have been enough to \"just\" make a frame. Of course there had to be a very analytical part too. To learn more about the strength of the welded and brazed parts, they made some mockups and put these in test machines. After that, Luca and Robert cut the joints open and inspected them with a microscope. This gave them valuable insights for the the welding and brazing processes for the actual frame. To make sure the frame would survive proper enduro riding, they got in touch with testing lab EFBE from Germany, which provided the team with data from its downhill testing program. All the calculations and assumptions they made are based on the EFBE DH test. For the 3D printed parts, they used topology optimization and the inputs they got from EFBE. It was a long(ish) process, as they did the calculations for every single part first and after that for the whole frame. The swingarm was also designed using topology optimization, that\\'s why it doesn\\'t look symmetrical. When all the calculations were done, FHNW did the machining and a partner company in Switzerland printed the other parts. The frame wouldn\\'t exist without Zurich framebuilding legend Wim Kolb, who helped them to weld and braze the frame and who also helped them a lot during the whole process. Brake levers from Oak Components. It\\'s not often that you see a stem that matches the dropper post. Funding from Innosuisse allowed the Lean Cycles team to get some 3D printed parts from a Swiss company. The lug is brazed at the seat tube and welded at the top tube. Luca hopes that the small grooves in the 3D printed parts can help to reduce stress concentrations. As this was the first bike they ever built, they tested their suspension design with Lego models first. No frame splitter needed on this bike to install the belt drive. How progressive? Yes. What will the future hold for Lean Cycles? One thing is for sure: They won\\'t sell this bike. Their main goal was to build their dream bike, to showcase their abilities and how modern technology can help to create outstanding bikes. Luca, Robert and Kilian from Lean Cycles would like to thank FHNW, Wim Kolb, Pinion, DT Swiss and Oak Components for their help.',\n",

       "  'date': '03-10-2025',\n",
       "  'text': \"MET Helmets have announced an all-new open face helmet, the Revo MIPS. It replaces the Roam helmet with a construction that offers improved ventilation over that predecessor. Highlights on this one include the impressively deep coverage at the rear, a good range of adjustment, and the quiet two-piece MIPS Air Node Liner. The Air Node liner deals with the rotational forces in an impact, while the polycarbonate-covered EPS takes care of more direct forces. On top of the obligatory CE, AZ/NZS and US safety certifications required to sell the helmet in those respective regions, the MET Revo MIPS conforms to the more recently introduced NTA safety standard required for Speed Pedelec, or e-bikes that provide assistance up to 45 km/h. Another stamp of approval for this helmet comes from independent helmet testers, Virginia Tech; a 5-Star rating is the highest rating possible, indicating that of the hundreds of helmets vying for your money, this is one of the safer options. MET Revo MIPS Details • MIPS Air Node Rotational Impact Protection • Magnetic Fidlock Buckle • In-mold Construction • Single Density EPS • 4-position adjustable visor • Cradle height adjustment • 23 vents • Actual Weight: 368 grams (Size S) • Sizes: S (52-56cm), M (56-58cm), L (58-61cm) • Price: 200,00 € / £169.99 / $230 USD / $300 CAD • Certifications: EN1078:2012 + A1:2012 and NTA 8776:2016-12 • Virginia Tech Rating: 5 Star (Score: 10.45) • met-helmets.com It isn't obligatory for MTB helmets, but MET is one of a growing number of helmet manufacturers (Specialized, POC, Fox, etc.) that choose to go above and beyond on that front; the NTA tests subject the helmet to multiple impacts over a greater area on the helmet, a little deeper on the shell than the standard testing. The Revo MIPS is a 5-Star rated helmet, receiving a score of 10.45 from Virginia Tech. The lower the score, the safer the helmet. A score of 10.45 puts it at #38 in the rankings, as compared to the 7.23 score of the current #1 , the Fox Speedframe Pro RS . Granted, the Speedframe Pro RS is considerably more expensive at $279 USD. However, it is worth highlighting that there are twelve mountain bike helmets that have received a lower (safer) score from Virginia Tech that come with a smaller price tag than the Revo MIPS. Performance & Construction The MET Revo MIPS has an in-mold construction with a single-density EPS. The coverage is notably very deep at the rear providing a little more than the Rogue Core helmet from sister brand Bluegrass. There are 23 vents distributed around the polycarbonate shell with deep ventilation channels visible on the inside leading to large exhaust vents at the rear. I won’t comment too much on how well ventilated a helmet is owing to my having a lot of hair, but I can tell you that MET go to great lengths to objectively test how cool their helmets are. Their in-house testing includes use of a wind tunnel and a head dummy heated to 38°C. By measuring changes in temperature of the dummy, the design engineers can determine what combination of vents and airflow channels delivers the best cooling effect. Inside we have a MIPS Air Node Liner, the function of which is to reduce concussive rotational forces during an impact. There are a multitude of MIPS liners, some of which can creak as they rub against the EPS shell. Happily, this Air Node variation is very quiet. It's also one of the lightest options going, combining the air pockets of the MIPS system with the comfort liner itself. On the Revo, the Air Node Liner is a two-piece affair. Due to the deep coverage a second liner was required for the occipital portion of the shell to ensure that the rotational impact protection adequately extends to that rear portion. RETENTION & ADJUSTMENTS My head circumference is 54cm putting me in the middle of the range of the size small I tested. While its features offer a good range of usable adjustment, for me, this is not the most comfortable and well-fitting helmet. I experienced pressure points at each side toward the rear of my head. I think the shape of the venting channels in this area narrows the helmet a bit. I prefer the fit of the Bluegrass Rogue Core which gives an even pressure everywhere. While the pressure points are evident initially I will say they aren't so prominent that I’m aware of them while riding. The head belt is a full wrap on the Revo so it tightens evenly when you cinch it down. It tightens from the back though so the smaller you make it the further the shell's position will be biased toward the front of your head. The dial on the cradle is a decent size so not too fiddly to adjust. The occipital height adjustment doesn't run on a ratchet system which is absolutely a good thing. In my experience those can slip when trails get rough resulting in the helmet's position shifting while riding, or while putting goggles on, requiring constant re-adjustment. With the more basic poppet design like that seen here on the Revo the retention system stays put. The visor has four indexed positions owing to an attachment point at the center that runs on a ratchet. It is reasonably flexible, designed to breakaway on impact to reduce rotational forces. That said, the fact that it is secured by three attachments instead of two likely means more force would be required before it broke away from the helmet body. Extremes of the visor position. Note: The Revo MIPS has a good range of occipital height adjustment. Here, I have it positioned with a rearward bias. I found the middle position to give a better fit, rotating the shell forward a little to give more coverage at the front. At the other end of the range, the front of the shell basically sits on my eyebrows. The MET Revo does offer storage for sunglasses though how secure it is will depend on the sunglasses themselves. The glasses I tested the helmet with don't have rubber on the arms for extra security so the glasses will bounce around and run the risk of falling out when riding over bumps. I guess helmet manufacturers could take matters into their own hands by providing rubber inserts against the wall of the ventilation channels to better grip the arms of the glasses. Importantly, the arms are able to slot all the way into the vents without contacting my head. PRICE At $230 USD, the MET Revo is one of the more expensive MIPS-equipped helmets that money can buy. I will mention again that there are twelve more affordable helmets ranked by Virginia Tech that have been award a lower (safer) score - like the $110 USD Specialized Tactic (Score: 8.55) which to my mind is still one of the best value mountain bike helmets money can buy. WEIGHT Claimed weight for the MET Revo MIPS in a size small is 370g; ours weighed in at 368 grams. That's fairly middle of the road, and on a par with the more expensive Fox Speedframe RS, Virginia Tech's top ranked MTB helmet, which gets the more advanced MIPS Integra Split. It's not particularly light, but with the deep coverage this helmet offers I wouldn't really expect it to be. Pros + Design prioritizes ventilation + Good range of usable adjustments + Space for sunglasses storage + No creaking + 5-Star Rating from Virginia Tech Cons - I experienced pressure points - There are lots of less expensive helmets with a better safety rating from Virginia Tech Pinkbike's Take The MET Revo Mips is a quality open-face helmet with a design that prioritizes ventilation. While its shape isn't the most comfortable for my head shape, the retention system does offer a good range of adjustment for dialing in the fit, and the sunglasses storage is a nice feature. While I am sure it will be a solid option for many, for me there isn't anything particularly standout about the Revo. It will be hard to justify purchasing this helmet over less expensive options that have performed better in independent safety tests. — Jessie-May\\xa0Morgan\",\n",

       "  'text': \"PRESS RELEASE: Crankworx Mountain biking enthusiasts, mark your calendars: from February 13-16, Crankworx Summer Series New Zealand will transform Ōtautahi Christchurch into the epicentre of gravity-fueled excitement. Against the breathtaking setting of Christchurch Adventure Park (CAP), riders from across the globe are set to converge for four days of high-stakes competition featuring three main events: Redemption Downhill, Pump Track Challenge, and New Zealand’s first-ever FMB Gold Cup Slopestyle. While athlete registration remains open, the early rider list is already stacked with a mix of international stars and local heroes, promising an adrenaline-charged showcase of skill and determination. For the first time, athletes have the opportunity to earn valuable points towards the prestigious Crankworx World Tour Series and the coveted King & Queen of Crankworx titles by competing in the Pump Track Challenge and Redemption Downhill, solidifying the festival’s significance on the global mountain bike stage. Spectators can catch all the action live on-site or watch the broadcast live on TV NZ or Pinkbike while aspiring competitors still have a chance to grab a spot before registration closes. Female Athletes to Watch The reigning Queen of Crankworx, Martha Gill, is among the top contenders heading to Christchurch. Gill’s skill in both the Downhill and Pump Track disciplines makes her a favourite, though competition from Kiwi stars like Jenna Hastings, Sacha Earnest, and Shania Rawson will undoubtedly test her limits. Hastings, fresh off an impressive comeback season, Earnest, who finished the 2024 UCI DH season in 3rd place, and Rawson, recipient of the 2024 Crankworx Trail Blazer Award, bring local pride to the lineup. The Pump Track Challenge also introduces first-time Crankworx competitor and reigning UCI Pump Track World Champion Sabina Košárková from the Czech Republic, adding international intrigue to an already stacked field. Other notable names include Louise Ferguson, a multi-discipline powerhouse shifting from Freeride to Downhill racing, and Jordy Scott, who narrowly missed the 2024 Queen title and is poised for redemption. Male Athletes to Watch New Zealand’s dominance is palpable, with nearly a third of the confirmed male athletes hailing from Aotearoa. Lachie Stevens-McNab leads the charge after a breakout year, aiming to build on his RockShox Taniwha Downhill victory at Crankworx Rotorua 2024. Tuhoto-Ariki Pene, former King of Crankworx and Rotorua local, is joining him, eager to capitalize on ‘home turf’ advantage. International challengers include reigning King of Crankworx Ryan Gilchrist from Australia, who dominated the 2024 World Tour, his fellow countryman Jackson Frew, and British rider Bernard Kerr, bringing his signature style to the Redemption Downhill. Slopestyle Athletes to Look Out For Being the first of its calibre in Aotearoa, New Zealand, the FMB Gold Cup Slopestyle promises to deliver unforgettable moments. David Godziek, 2024 Slopestyle World Champion and Triple Crown winner, attends as the man to beat. Chasing him are heavy hitters from Europe like Erik Fedko and Lucas Huppert, as well as young Canadian talent like Griffin Paulson, Chance Moore, and Ben Thompson. The 2024 Red Bull Rookie of the Year and rising star Kaidan Ingersoll is poised to be a standout this season as he goes head-to-head with elite Crankworx Slopestyle World Championship (SWC) competitors. Red Bull athlete Patricia Druwen’s return after a 2024 hiatus sets the stage for fierce competition in the women's division. Joining her are SWC riders Canadian Natasha Miller and USA’s Shealen Reno, the first-ever female Slopestyle World Champion. Adding to the anticipation, the Christchurch Gold Cup Slopestyle will host first-time competitor Kirsten Van Horne from Canada. This promising dark horse has already showcased impressive skills and undeniable potential, setting the stage to disrupt the competition while carving out her place on the international circuit. Van Horne will also be vying for one of the coveted wildcards to the Maxxis Slopestyle at Crankworx Rotorua, adding an extra layer of stakes to her debut. Beyond the Races The festival kicks off on February 13 with a Jump Jam at CAP’s iconic Mulchy Jump, bringing local and international riders together in a spectacle of flips, whips, and style.

Tasmania aka Tassie, is Australia’s only island state and this rugged little island is filled with lush, dense forest and its reputation as a mountain biking hotspot has exploded over recent years, luring riders from all over the world. Maydena Bike Park is a gravity park with over 800m of elevation (most of any bike park in Australia) that officially opened in January 2018. It's located in Tasmania’s scenic Derwent Valley - an easy 1 hour and a 15-minute drive from Hobart CBD, or a 1 hour and 30-minute drive from Hobart airport. Jackson Goldstone giving The Local his signature 'tap' of approval. The Local is just one of close to 100 individual trails at Maydena Bike Park. It combines dense temperate rainforest vibes with epic, perfectly groomed jumps, rollers, and berms. Located on the lower slopes of the bike park, The Local can be accessed via a wide variety of technical, flow, or jump trails. There are two different uplift services, a fast turn around Lower Mountain ATV shuttle, and the Full Mountain shuttle bus service, taking in every metre of the parks immense 820m vertical elevation range... (be right back, going to look at flights). The park is closed during the [Southern Hemisphere's] Winter months and usually opens near the end of September. Long-travel trail bikes or DH rigs are recommended - there is a bike rental shop at the base if you don't want to travel with your own rig, along with a cafe & beer garden so you can have a break, grab a coffee, or chat over a beer and good food after a day of riding. Despite being the home of Red Bull Hardline in Australia, and having hosted multiple world-level gravity events, Maydena Bike Park also has one of Australia’s biggest networks of beginner-friendly flow trails - check out some of their recommendations . The Dirt Art team worked their magic to design and craft this place into a MTB Mecca and are well-known for their sustainable trail design methodologies, and construction. It’s not just flow and jump trails here, half the trails at Maydena are natural, hand built tech trails and each one is unique, making the options endless with each lap. The Local is a jump trail with pretty much everything including hips both ways, nice and wide and when dry it would run prime and even let you slow down a bit so you can get more pop. - Mitch\\xa0(hardinggrim) It's safe to say that Tassie is that like that quiet friend who lets everyone else brag, but deep down, it’s holding some of the best trails, the kind you’ll never stop thinking about.\",\n",

       " {'title': 'Review: Industry Nine Hydra 2 Hubs - 870 Points of Engagement & Increased Durability',\n",
       "  'author': 'Dario DiGiulio',\n",
       "  'date': '03-06-2025',\n",
       "  'text': 'Six years ago, Industry Nine blew minds with their release of the Hydra rear hub. They drew people in with unprecedented engagement, easy maintenance, and domestically-manufactured pedigree. Over the years though, the Hydra\\'s durability proved a weak point, and led to some premature failures and increased maintenance requirements over other simple hub designs. Industry Nine learned a lot from the many Hydras released into the world over the years, and integrated those lessons into the new Hydra 2 hub with a focus on durability and drag. Hydra 2 Details • 870 points of engagement, 0.41° • Increased durability throughout • Four axle standard options • J-bend or i9 spoke standards • 12 colors • Weight: 1710g, MX Enduro Carbon wheelset • Hubset Price: $700 USD • Wheelset Price: $995-$2,295 USD • industrynine.com Hydra 1 I was working at a shop when the Hydra was initially launched, and bought a rear hub soon after they were available, just to see how significantly they could change the ride experience. For technical climbing requiring finesse and careful pedal placement, they really did impress, with no detectable slop in the pedals as you hit the engagement point. After quickly getting used to the high engagement feeling, I came to enjoy it in the right circumstances, though it never felt like an absolute necessity. To this day, I\\'m still fine with standard 10° hubs, for the majority of riding scenarios. Over the years, my experience with the original Hydras soured a bit, due primarily to poor durability and the amount of drag they generate. I don\\'t have an accurate count, but I\\'ve personally broken a handful of axles in the rear hub, and have seen many more out in the wild. Industry Nine made a rolling change to the axle design in 2023, deleting the stress riser that seemed to be the genesis of most of those failures. Still, the overall design and bearing layout led to a fair bit of drag when tensioned in a frame, which does translate to some rolling speed out on the trails. Lots of hub manufacturers are honing in on drag as a negative variable in their updates, and Industry Nine is trying to tackle this in tandem with the durability improvements made to Hydra 2. The Updates Industry Nine gave the Hydras a complete makeover for their second iteration, with a revised layout and updated design that should increase durability on all fronts, while also improving some of the performance metrics. The engineering team at i9 says the changes to the design are as follows: • Rear axle update for increased strength, externally butted and 68% thicker than the outgoing design, with stress washer at the freehub to reduce loads. • Bearings utilize additional radial preload - same as with the Solix hubs - in order to reduce drag and increase bearing life. • Full contact outboard seals, to better protect internals from the outside environment. • Drive ring is 7% larger, and pawls now have 3 teeth each, in order to reduce the force between the two by 21%. The tooth depth is shallower, reducing the hub\\'s overall noise. • Larger pawl pockets to dissipate force more evenly and prevent elongation. Tougher metal on the drivering to prevent stripping or premature wear. • Hydra 2 has higher engagement (870 points / 0.41°) to reduce the flex required to engage multiple pawls. Less flex should yield higher durability. • Higher torque rating allows for use on Class 1 and Class 3 eMTBs. These updates are all unique to the Hydra 2 redesign, and won\\'t be backwards compatible to the Hydra 1 architecture. Those with the original hubs will have to pony up for a fresh set if the durability and drag improvements are of interest. One key element not laid out above is the brake-side bearing durability, which proved quite problematic on the original Hydra design. Specifically on the 6-bolt hubs, that outboard bearing would die a quick death in any sort of inclement weather, due to the proximity to the edge of the hub and general lack of sealing. The updated design places that bearing much further back in the hub, and allows for a larger seal to keep water and grime out of the area. Pricing & Availability Hydra 2 hubs will be available on their own, or built into a wide variety of Industry Nine wheelsets. Like all i9 hubs, the Hydra 2 can be purchased with either standard J-bend steel spokes (S-series, by their nomenclature), or with their proprietary System straight-pull aluminum spokes. There are wheelsets available with both options, with spoke count, axle spacing, and brake mounts available in a wide variety as well. I\\'ve been testing the Enduro Carbon System wheels, in a mixed 27.5/29\" set. As you can see below, Industry Nine is still offering the Hydra 2 in a bevy of axle standards, so just about everyone can feel included in the party. Performance I installed these wheels on my bike in late October last year, and they\\'ve been in service ever since. Four to five months isn\\'t enough to gauge true long term durability, but so far, the Hydra 2 has held up admirably well. Through a couple nasty months of winter riding, a fair bit of eMTB mileage, and no service whatsoever, they\\'ve proved unfazed. As a testament to their improved weather sealing, the factory grease is still clean in some areas of the hub internals, which often fouls up after only a few weeks of slop immersion. My list of damages is very short so far, with only one broken spoke to report. It cracked up at the nipple, and whether due to fatigue or an on-trail strike I can\\'t say - luckily it was easily replaced. Even if durability is slightly less than the steel alternative, there\\'s something unique about the ride characteristic of Industry Nine\\'s alloy spokes; the wheels feel taught, especially side to side. I liked the precise feel on long travel bikes through the winter months, but could see them feeling a bit pointy once trails dry up for good. If I were building a wheelset for bike park riding or general downhill performance, I\\'d lace the Hydras to a rim of choice with standard steel J-bend spokes. But for varied trail riding, and the right use case, the lighter, springier feel of the alloy spokes and i9\\'s carbon rim make for a lively package. On the hub front, there\\'s not too much to comment on besides the current state of durability (good!), the drag (less!), and the increased engagement (instant!). I\\'m not married to the concept of super high engagement hubs, but in the right circumstances they\\'re impressive . Southwest US-style ledgy climbing, where ratcheting the feet is paramount to success, tends to be the ideal use case, but anyone who likes weird tech climbs should appreciate the fidelity the Hydra 2\\'s offer. For folks who dig on chain devices or those riding gearbox bikes will probably appreciate the near-instant engagement as well, with the hub taking up any slack left by your fancy drivetrain additions. While some may love to hear their hubs screaming down the trail, I tend to prefer my wheels quiet. The Hydra 2 sound profile is a little less high-pitched than the original, but they still get pretty loud while coasting fast or back pedaling. I’ve found adding either Dumonde freehub oil or some Slickhoney grease cuts the noise down a bit, but it tends to only last about one ride or so. Again, most probably dig this feature - just my two cents. My last comment comes to drag, where the original Hydra was a serious offender. The Hydra 2 improves on this significantly, with the rear wheel spinning smoothly to a slow stop, even while clamped tight in various frame designs. There are definitely lower drag options out there, and I tend to prefer them for that little bit of extra coasting speed, but those hunting for maximum hub engagement should be happy with the balance struck in this redesign. Pros + Near-instant engagement, lower drag + Easy service, improved durability (so far) Cons - Still quite loud while coasting - Drag and complexity tradeoffs might not be worthwhile to those not hunting engagement Pinkbike\\'s Take Industry Nine\\'s Hydra 1 was favored for the very impressive engagement it offered, but fell behind the competition when it came to durability and coasting drag. Learning from years of feedback, it\\'s clear that the folks in Asheville have done their homework, improving the Hydra platform on all fronts for the second edition. Increased engagement is a convenient upside of improved durability, and the reduced drag simply adds to the list of upgrades. Though nearly instantaneous hub engagement isn\\'t something everybody seeks out, those who do are bound to be impressed by the Hydra 2. I wouldn\\'t call one winter a truly long-term test, but so far the hubs have proven reliable, and I\\'m looking forward to putting them through the wringer for the rest of the\\xa0year. — Dario\\xa0DiGiulio',\n",

Brage is quickly earning a reputation as one of the greatest freeride mountain bikers of all time, and films like this only reinforce that notion—going farther and deeper than anyone before to ride unfathomable lines in the remote Alaskan backcountry. Brage teamed up once again with Blur Media, a duo we've seen many times before and hope to keep seeing. This short film truly has it all: stunning visuals, jaw-dropping (pardon the pun) terrain, and Brage’s nonstop stoke. It’s a must-watch. Grab the popcorn, crack open a refreshment, and strap yourself in for 20 minutes of madness.

       "  'text': 'We are proud to present \"Blue Ribbon\", a public trail located on Galbraith Mountain in Bellingham, WA. This project is the culmination of years of permitting work, hours of machine time, and finished off by selfless volunteer work. Watch the video above to learn about how it came to be, and come visit us in Bellingham to catch a lap down this mind bending trail! Step 1: All trails require one thing, a corridor. To establish ours for this project we worked with local trail advocacy group, the WMBC, to obtain permits and find a window of time for construction. All said and done, this took nearly four years from when we kicked off the project proposal to when we broke ground. During that time we walked the proposed zone, looking for the right grade to create the flow we were after. With the planning and layout completed, the trail building mastermind, Nico Vink, arrived to start breaking ground. Step 2: Realize it\\'s too much work for one person and call your friends. We quickly realized it would be too much work for Nico so we called in TR GiddyUp ambassadors Teddy Jaramillo and Henry Lanman. They run a trail building operation in New Mexico, and were the perfect people to get on the job. Nico had always wanted to work with a crew of three and this project lined up perfect for that. Henry ran the big excavator clearing corridor and mining dirt while Teddy followed creating general shapes for Nico to finish and fine tune in his machine. Step 3: Dig \\'till you can\\'t dig anymore, then dig a little more. Nico, Henry and Ted were able to work for a solid month of spring, 2023, before the dirt became too dry to continue shaping. Nico then returned to Belgium to ride his bike and process the work he had already completed on Blue Ribbon. Giving him a summer to visualize the flow he had in mind for the trail. With some refreshed energy, he returned to Bellingham that Fall to complete the machine work on the trail. Countless days ensued with the help of WMBC\\'s Ryan Joslyn to create the final shapes that you can ride on Blue Ribbon today. Step 4: Find every available shovel and pair of hands to butter up the trail after the winter. With all the machine work in the past, it was time for us and the community to get our hands dirty and butter up the remaining bits of the trail. Nico had done almost 95% of the work with the machine, but a few transitions still needed some shaping. With the help of the community and a company dig day the trail took its final transformations and was ready to ride. Step 5: Open the trail to the world, and get some laps! After battling with some wacky Spring weather, we finally opened Blue Ribbon in June of 2024. Thanks to everyone who helped along the way and came out for the opening celebration. And a huge shout to Nico Vink for his relentless work and contributing to making this community better and better. This trail was a huge effort, and we are stoked to give it to the community. Hope to see you out there soon! You can find the trail HERE . Grab your friends and check it out this Fall!',\n",

       "  'text': \"Words: rideBiXS Barcelona has long been a hotspot for urban culture and street sports. Costa Brava serves as a mecca for BMX, inline skating, and scooters, while La Poma attracts dirt jumpers from around the globe during winter. Its unique urban architecture provides endless opportunities for creative riders. For Adrien Loron, Barcelona is more than just a destination—it’s a second home. Years ago, he and his friends would escape the cold by spending weeks riding the city. Now, Adrien spends half the year there, using the city’s countless staircases as his training ground for the Urban Downhill World Tour. This latest video project was a chance for Adrien to push his riding to the next level. His goal was to explore the urban environment in new ways, unlocking fresh lines and tackling unique spots. By switching between different bikes, he was able to make the most of each location and adapt to the challenges they presented. Years of exploring the city made scouting easier, but the project still demanded lots of creativity, precision, and courage. A wooden ramp, a couple of motivated friends, and a lot of determination were all it took to turn his ideas into reality. The pressure while riding these spots was real. In Cataluña, police patrols are constant, and riding in open public spaces isn’t always understood. You have to be quick—visualize the stunt, set up fast, and go. Sometimes, it’s a one-shot deal with no room for mistakes. Every spot has a story, and every shot feels like a\\xa0victory. — Adrien\\xa0Loron The project wasn’t without its challenges. Some of the wildest ideas didn’t pan out, but Adrien and his team still managed to capture unforgettable moments. This experience also deepened Adrien’s love for street riding, and he’s already planning more projects like this in the future. Special thanks to Adrien's friends, without whom the video project could not have been realized: Pipe Vergara | Mati Rojas | Vitor Buchli\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Photo: Riders enjoy the trails at Maple Mountain in North Cowichan, BC, during the MegaVolt eMTB Festival, the first ebike event put on by BC Bike Race. PRESS RELEASE: BC Bike Race For the first time ever, the BC Bike Race has opened registration to e-bikers for the 2025 edition of the race. Remaining true to its roots as an innovator in the mountain bike events space, BCBR will be the first multi-day stage race in North America to launch an e-bike category. This follows on the heels of other international events, such as the Wines2Whales in South Africa and the Volcanic Epic in New Zealand. “This has been our minds for nearly 10 years since a few German racers asked us why we don’t have a category for eMTB. North America was then and still is about 10 years behind the European adoption of electric bikes. We believe it’s time to start including them in our\\xa0event.” — Andreas Hestler, Co-founder and Marketing Director for BC Bike\\xa0Race Dubbed the eBCBR, the new category will be open to both SL and full-power eMTBs and will run as a separate and concurrent event. This means the race will NOT mix electric and acoustic on the course at the same time and will create a schedule that gives both rider groups The Ultimate Singletrack Experience. There will also be an untimed option for those who want to ride the course without the pressure of a timing chip. The Journey to This Latest Evolution: BC Bike Race has always evolved alongside the Mountain Bike Industry. At our inception in 2007, the majority of bikes were aluminum hardtails with 26-inch wheels, and there wasn’t a dropper post in sight. Over time, carbon became the norm, full suspension took over, gear ratios grew, and good rubber started to hit the ground. As bikes evolved, the BCBR course has evolved, incorporating more singletrack and more technical terrain. BCBR gives racers the most, and arguably the best, singletrack of any stage race in the world. Now, there are eMountain Bikes. Embracing the history, growth and development of mountain biking, the BC Bike Race is evolving to give more people the chance to enjoy The Ultimate Singletrack Experience. More About the eBCBR: Date: June 30 – July 6th, 2025 Location: Vancouver Island – British Columbia Stage 1 – Victoria Stage 2 – Victoria Stage 3 – Cowichan Valley Stage 4 – Nanaimo Stage 5 – Cumberland Stage 6 – Campbell River Stage 7 – Cumberland BC Bike Race website Photo Credits : Dave Silver',\n",

       " 'documents': [[\"Dario DiGiulio's 2025 Predictions: Behold, the visions of the seer. More radial tires. Schwalbe beat the competition to the punch with their radial tire release, but I don't think things will settle with that first release. The concept has legs, and the ride quality the tires offer seems to impress everyone that has a chance to ride them. As far as I understand it, the concept isn’t under patent protection, and can be iterated with various thread counts and casing approaches beyond the basic orientation change. I for one am stoked to see what the rubber wizards do with the idea over the next year or two. More downhill bikes. I think we’re going to see a few brands that historically haven’t offered a standalone downhill bike come to market with race bikes. My reasoning for this guess is as such: The DH World Cup is aiming to be a more premier and “important” series, with participants theoretically getting focused screen time and consistent results. That should encourage any brand with assets to spend to consider entering the ring, and offering their own ride for athletes to showcase. Add to that the supposedly democratized Continental series that the UCI has announced, and you’ll have a burgeoning market of aspiring racers looking for a solid race bike. DH bikes have never been a massive market, and of late if feels like most people are gravitating towards pedal-friendly machines, but this revised take on professional racing could stoke some competition on the brand end. Stronger brakes. The SRAM Mavens are the most powerful commonly available brakes on the market at this point, by some margin. Raw power isn’t the end-all be-all, but a high bar has been set for that one parameter, so I’d venture a guess that we’ll see more attempts at that accolade. Whether or not this is something you’re on the hunt for, I think the benefits come to light once you’ve had the chance to try something that can fundamentally change the way you approach braking, opening up new lines and speeds. Integrated complication. Last year I staked my claim on user-changeable frame stiffness being an increasingly common element on production bikes. While that didn’t catch on quite yet, I still think that’s on deck. I may be recycling from last year's list, but I still feel this one coming, so here's it is again.\",\n",

       " 'documents': ['The Man Behind the Berms: Kyle Strait on Crafting Sea Otter’s Dual Slalom: Words: Dan Hughes I get bored easily…as a human and as a\\xa0rider. — Kyle\\xa0Strait This sentiment, expressed by the man behind the dual slalom courses at the Life Time Sea Otter Classic presented by Continental, Kyle Strait, goes a long way to explaining the continued excitement and staying power of the discipline at Laguna Seca. From young racer to master builder, Strait’s cycling career has taken him around the globe, but always with a soft spot for Sea Otter. Originally from Southern California, Strait first encountered Sea Otter through the pages of mountain bike magazines. Inspired by what he saw, he asked his father if they could attend and, in 2000, got his first taste of the scale of a Sea Otter. You come up the hill to the guard shack and can see the whole place, the XC folks, the pits, and the hill where the dual slalom is…it’s\\xa0huge. — Kyle\\xa0Strait But the size of Sea Otter didn’t seem to deter Strait, and it didn’t take long for him to make his mark, winning the (adult) Pro Dirt Jumping competition at the age of 13. From there, Strait would become a fixture not only at Sea Otter but in the world of slopestyle riding, missing only two Sea Otters since 1999 (one when Sea Otter’s date was moved to the fall, and one when he was rehabbing a broken knee cap) and being the only rider invited to every edition of the Red Bull Rampage (and its first two-time champion). This connection to the sport is what helped Strait add course-building to his resume as a rider. After years of building tracks for himself and others, Strait got the call from Sea Otter to design the dual slalom courses in 2022. I had built lots of tracks as an amateur, but when I had the opportunity to carry on the legacy of Keith Defiebre (longtime Sea Otter dual slalom course designer) and work on the tracks at Laguna Seca, I, of course, said\\xa0‘yes.’ — Kyle\\xa0Strait But the work on the hillside wasn’t straightforward, both in terms of soil and the task at hand: You’ve got four different kinds of dirt to deal with there, and the weather. It’s also one of the only sports you can do where professionals at a high level and amateurs use the same course. You’ve got to design a course that’s challenging and safe for every\\xa0rider. — Kyle\\xa0Strait Strait’s process for course building is a time-intensive process. Starting 21 days out, he and his team build features from scratch with an eye towards accommodating riders of every stripe and incorporating features from favourite tracks around the world. For a pro, I might build three rollers that they can triple, but an amateur can roll, and I also want to take care of the adaptive racers, making sure the track is at least 39” wide. Sometimes, I think ‘that section from CrankWorx was awesome, let’s do\\xa0that. — Kyle\\xa0Strait And then comes the testing, which Strait does himself, although he has to employ a few tricks to approximate the feel for each rider group. I try to give myself as many handicaps as possible when I do the testing to get a sense of what it’ll feel like for a first-time rider. I’ll do the whole course seated, or with no brakes, or with my hands reversed to make sure it’s rideable for\\xa0everyone. — Kyle\\xa0Strait On race day, upwards of 600 athletes put the course through its paces with multiple practice runs, qualifiers, and the finals. Winners are crowned, and Strait takes photos to document the courses before they’re wiped away for another year. It’s a county park, so we return it to its natural state. That means we have to start from scratch at every Sea Otter, which is a challenge, but we craft unique courses every year and get different winners as well. If the 2024 course wasn’t what you like in dual slalom, then you’ll probably love the 2025\\xa0course. — Kyle\\xa0Strait In the end, Strait’s stewardship of the dual slalom event is about more than just one rider’s love of the sport; it’s a confirmation of the sport’s place in a score of riders’ histories. I remember sitting in the back of my dad’s truck, trying to warm up from the freezing rain, competing against riders years older than me in the 18-and-under category [in 2000]. Sea Otter has kept three generations of dual slalom riders going. I’m proud to be part of\\xa0that. — Kyle\\xa0Strait',\n",

       "  \"Race Report: New Zealand’s 2025 Enduro MTB National Championships: Words: Cable Bay Enduro The Cable Bay Enduro and New Zealand Enduro MTB National Championships took place over the weekend at the Cable Bay Adventure Park in Nelson, offering riders three exhilarating days of practice and racing under perfect weather conditions. The event, now in its sixth edition, featured eight challenging stages spread across two days, with a half-day of practice and racing on Saturday, followed by a full day of competition on Sunday. Saturday's action commenced with shuttled practice sessions on the initial stages, allowing riders to familiarise themselves with the terrain before tackling the first three timed stages later in the day. The atmosphere was electric, with participants ranging from first-time racers to seasoned professionals, all eager to make their mark on the national championship course. For racing, riders were given a short shuttle before pedalling through some of Cable Bay Adventure Park's most lush terrain. Stage one for this year was The Poacher, a new trail which opened for last year’s event. The trail includes a big rock roll, which this year claimed a few riders who were pushing hard to beat the clock. Stage 2 was a short but punchy stage, which had been left with minimal catches after practice. It was a fine line between getting through unscathed and pushing too hard and blowing corners out, with some finding the limit. To finish day 1 of racing riders descended Veto and were met by over 300+ spectators, many of whom were dressed up with the hope of winning the Soundboks Go speaker that was up for grabs. Sunday's full day of racing encompassed five additional stages, each presenting its own set of technical challenges and demanding terrains. Riders navigated a cumulative elevation gain of approximately 1600 meters over 30 kilometres and over 2000 metres of descents. The well-maintained trails of Cable Bay Adventure Park, combined with the favourable weather, provided ideal racing conditions. However, as the day went on, the heat began to take its toll. The opening stage for Day 2 was a brand new trail which opened for the event. The trail, named The Courthouse, certainly served up some challenges as riders descended deep into the valley floor. The Courthouse was not only the longest descent of the weekend, but it included the steepest sections as well. Following stage 4, riders were on their own with no more shuttle assistance. Stage 5 was a park favourite CCR into Lost Time, followed by Stage 6, Broken Gnome, Stage 7, Missing Link into Jurassic, before tackling the final Stage 8, PineIine. Crossing the finish line, riders were handed a cold refreshment thanks to the team at Two Thumb Brewery before watching the remainder of the field tackle the stage. As times were confirmed, riders enjoyed more refreshments and a buffet meal to conclude an epic weekend of riding. With the sun still shining, the awards ceremony was one to remember as riders, sponsors and volunteers were celebrated for all their efforts. The winners of the Under 19 and Elite divisions were as follows: Elite Men: 1st Place: Brady Stone (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Joe Millington 3rd Place: Lachie Ross Elite Women: 1st Place: Xanthe Robb (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Winni Goldsbury 3rd Place: Zoe Trolove Under 19 Men: 1st Place: Eli Robertson (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Nico Schroder 3rd Place: Seppy Binsbergen Under 19 Women: 1st Place: Lucy Kemp (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Iley Nunns Full results here The Cable Bay Enduro continues to solidify its reputation as a premier event on New Zealand's mountain biking calendar, offering riders of all levels an opportunity to compete in a professionally organized and challenging environment. The success of this year's championships underscores the dedication of the organizers, volunteers, and sponsors in promoting the growth and recognition of Enduro mountain biking in New Zealand. For 2026, The Cable Bay Enduro will once more take place at Cable Bay Adventure Park and will certainly be an event not to miss as the organizers have some exciting plans taking shape. The reins for the National Championships, however, will be passed on to whom we have yet to find out! Photo credit thanks to Digby Shaw & Rory Stock\",\n",

You'll be double-dipping this track for sure! Boomslang is unlike any other trail in the park. With its raw, natural terrain, you can expect a track that evolves with every run. The ever-changing nature of the trail means no two runs will ever feel the same. From drops, jumps and root gaps to high-speed sections and creative line options, Boomslang is a challenge for all riders. If you remember how the top section of this trail evolved, this lower half will follow a similar journey. What starts off as deep loam will turn to a raw mudder through this winter. Then, as people ride it, new lines will open up and get rutted in, and more rock will appear. Prepare for a different feel every time you ride it. Boomslang can be found by traversing across towards the start of Pandoras Rocks, Fifty Shades and Terry’s Belly. The new start hill for Boomslang, giving you better speed for the flowier top section, is on the left as you pedal across. It heads down the steepest part of our hillside through thick woods, open off-camber sections with built-up gaps and big box features. Trail Highlights Type: Natural Tech Black Downhill Features: Drops, off-camber loam, berms, ruts, doubles, and flat-out speed sections Unique Appeal: Constantly evolving trail, raw and technical, offering a fresh challenge every ride. “We’re incredibly excited to launch the new bottom half of Boomslang. This trail is a game-changer—not just for us but for riders who crave the thrill of natural, technical terrain.

       "  \"Interview: Cam McCaul Talks Natural Selection Bike Event: INTERVIEW Cam McCaul On Natural Selection Bike Words by Stephane Pelletier / Photos: Izzy Lidsky, Tyler Roemer Cam McCaul is a true legend of the sport. A rider who inspired thousands with his riding and energy, he continues to shape the sport as a pro rider, commentator, and all-around personality. Most recently, Cam's been deep in the development of Natural Selection Bike, Todd Barber's brainchild, and a real evolution from the Proving Grounds and Rampage formats we're used to. I got the chance to sit down with Cam and chat about Natural Selection, how it all came together, where it's headed, and what everyone can look forward to in tomorrow's broadcast. The live broadcast of NST Bike kicks off March 5th at 12 PM PST. In the meantime, enjoy Cam! Cam McCaul, Proving Grounds, Pacific City, Oregon. Natural Selection has been a groundbreaking event in snowboarding—how did the idea of bringing it to mountain biking first come about Cam McCaul: Todd Barber started “Proving Grounds,” which had the original mission of creating an event that could fill the gap between slopestyle and Rampage. In a nutshell, Proving Grounds caught the attention of Natural Selection as they were exploring the idea of expanding into other sports. If you think about it, there’s a common motivation there. NST was started by Travis Rice, looking to fill a gap in competitive snowboarding. Todd was doing a similar thing with mountain biking, and those paths converged. To be honest, I think NST is a great direction forward for all four sports that are involved (snowboarding, ski, surf, MTB), and I’m just so excited that mountain biking gets to be a part of it. What was your role in helping make this event a reality? Cam McCaul: If you really believe in something and you want to see it come to life, you’re just down to get in wherever you fit in. I initially fit in as someone Todd could brainstorm his ideas with during the Proving Grounds days. That evolved into wandering around the woods with Todd, Carson Storch, and Kyle Jameson trying to envision course designs for the original Proving Grounds in Prineville, Oregon, then I was creating content to promote that event, then I was test-riding some features, then I was the “Athlete Liaison” to kind of be the conduit between the athletes and the event crew, then I was the announcer for the event, then the host of the broadcast once it got to that stage, etc. Now that Proving Grounds has evolved into Natural Selection Bike, I’m working with the NST team in a lot of different ways to ensure we’re staying true to our sport, creating something that fills a void, helping with athlete selections, running the @naturalselectionbike Instagram account under the guidance of our NST social whizzes, announcing the event on-site, and I’ll be in the studio for the broadcast coming up March 5. How did you and the rest of the team go about choosing New Zealand as the location for the first-ever Natural Selection MTB event? Cam McCaul: New Zealand is not only full of great terrain and natural beauty but Queenstown, in particular, is also kind of THE SPOT for mountain biking during our northern hemisphere winters. I wasn’t on the scout trip when they chose the location, but if you watch the documentary “Search for Natural Selection Bike,” you can see how many different potential venues they explored before finally finding the right one. They seriously left no stone unturned in the search. It’s insane how dialled the venue at Mt. Dewar is for this event, first and foremost for the terrain, the pitch, the quality of dirt, etc., but also because Queenstown feels like the MTB epicentre this time of year. Everywhere you look, there are iconic zones, and the majority of the best riders in the world are passing through all season. Plus, the locals are some of the best people ever in addition to being some of the best riders/builders in the world. Cam McCaul, Proving Grounds, Pacific City, Oregon. What were the biggest challenges in adapting the Natural Selection concept to mountain biking? Cam McCaul: Well, the best part is, that’s not really the objective… It’s not a mission to create a snowboarding contest on mountain bikes. The mission is to create something new, unique and true to OUR SPORT. Each sport NST gets involved with has the creative freedom to structure its events to fill a needed gap in that individual sport. Coincidentally (or not), what this ends up creating is something that runs parallel with the riding that the athletes do on their own time and in their video parts. What kind of riding style and athlete mindset does this format reward compared to traditional freeride or slopestyle events? Cam McCaul: I’d say it really rewards riders who spend less time on the airbags and more time on the trails. Yes, you need tricks to do well, but maintaining flow and remembering speeds in order to link together a great top-to-bottom run really ended up being the most valuable skill a rider could bring to this event. I had this realization halfway through the week while watching practice – The riders who end up on the podium will be the ones who nail the best one-take segment in their contest run. How much usable footage for a segment can you produce in your comp run…? You gotta rip the trail sections, roost the berms, pop the hips, trick the drops, trick the jumps. The riders who drop runs that could be a film segment…those are the riders who will score high and place well. Sensai for the new generation. The terrain looked absolutely insane—what were some of the key elements that made this course unique? Cam McCaul: The top and middle of the venue are where the natural terrain features are on display. Making those natural features rideable and linking them together with singletrack and bike-park flow sections was a task that the build team executed beautifully. At the bottom, it opens up into really big jumps. The combination of the top, the middle, and the bottom is what makes this event unique. Linking a clean run through the whole thing is no easy task. How did the riders respond to the course? Were there any surprises in how they approached it? Cam McCaul: The runs are long, and the features are big. The first course walk day, all the riders hiked around and realized that learning these lines would be something that would take time. Each rider approached practice differently and had their own process. One rider’s approach that was insanely impressive (but not really surprising because he has done this before) was Dylan Stark. Dylan just wastes no time… He gets straight to the top of the course and does a T to B. Even if there are features that haven’t been guinnea’d yet, he just drops in and links a run. Natural Selection in snowboarding has a distinct judging format—how did you translate that into mountain biking? Cam McCaul: It’s called CREDO, which stands for Creativity, Risk, Execution, Difficulty, and Overall Impression. In all contests, I have a firm belief that the overall impression should matter most. It’s a nice idea, but in a lot of cases, it falls apart because most events have pre-determined point deductions for things like slipped pedals, crashes, etc. At NST Bike, you can literally crash and get back up, and if the merit of the things that are done successfully is heavy enough, it’s possible to bank a respectable score to build upon. In this event, there are two different trails, and the men’s riders take one run on each. So the men have a combined score for the two different runs, with no throw-aways. This format really rewards consistency. Max score for run 1 is 50 points, max score for run 2 is 50 points. The highest combined score (out of a possible 100) after those two runs takes the cake. In the spirit of having the flexibility to make adjustments as needed to ensure things are done right, the decision was made by the Women’s field to adjust their format from 2 runs to 1. Social media guy. Were there any specific moments that stood out to you as defining what this event is all about? Cam MCCaul: Absolutely… Finley Kirschenmann and Janelle Soukup. The timing of their trajectories as riders and how that converged with this event taking shape is super special. They both earned their invites through the “Dream Ticket” qualifying event and then absolutely killed it in their final runs at Mt. Dewar. This event is probably more suited toward veteran riders with long histories in the sport because the venue and format are so demanding. Yet, these two have already racked up well-rounded backgrounds and diverse skill sets at a very young age, and they put it all on display with pressure. They really do represent an exciting glimpse into the future. Some of the best freeride events have a strong storytelling element—how did you want this event to stand out in terms of visuals and coverage? I think from a “storytelling” perspective, the story is simple. Create a couple of the most fun and challenging feature-filled trails on earth, get some of the best riders to take one run on each of the trails, shoot it like it’s a film segment, and whoever kills it the most wins the event. When you’re riding with your friends, you know who’s ripping the hardest. This is just like that but elevated. There will be less controversy from viewers because there are fewer “apples to oranges” comparisons going on, and it will be easier for recreational mountain bikers to relate and enjoy watching. It’s not an anomaly…It’s mountain biking…at a very high level, yes…but it looks like mountain biking. Another thought, if you were to have a group of 10 riders ride one berm or one jump and then rank them 1-10 in order of who rode it best, it would be hard. Maybe you could easily determine who got first and who got last, but figuring out who placed 4th – 8th would be insane. The fact that these lines at NST Queenstown are long, and you’re being judged on two runs, creates more room for separation. It creates room for the strongest riders to rise to the surface but also more room for differentiation in the middle of the pack. Checking out the NST Track. This event seems to bridge the gap between backcountry freeride and competition—do you think it represents a new path for mountain biking? Cam McCaul: This event is one iteration of the many different paths it can potentially take in the future. No one location or terrain type defines mountain biking or the “freeride” side of mountain biking. If an event series is going to truly represent freeride mountain biking, the event series needs to be as versatile as the sport itself and able to experiment and evolve. Instead of saying it represents a “new path” for mountain biking, I’d say it represents a whole new “trail network” of possibilities. Could you see Natural Selection growing into a multi-stop series like in snowboarding? If so, where would you love to see future events held? Cam McCaul: Heck yeah. I think each location that becomes home for future events will also dictate what type of format the event takes on, what riders get invited, etc. This Queenstown event is held on really challenging trails/jump lines, like Coronet Peak on steroids. Another event could be held in a desert zone with chutes, fade-aways, and cliff drops. There could be another event in the woods with wild freeride stunts connected by trail sections. Let your imagination run wild with the things that you love about mountain biking, and create a contest for it. That is what this is for. How do you think this format challenges riders differently than Rampage or the Fest Series? Cam McCaul: Rampage is a one-of-a-kind spectacle and is untouchable in terms of the box that it checks. Fest is a series of all-time jam sessions on huge jumps. Freeride can’t be put into a box, so it makes more sense to have a lot of different boxes and figure out the right ways to check them. Cam McCaul, Proving Grounds, Pacific City, Oregon. What impact do you think this event could have on the next generation of freeriders? Cam McCaul: Riders will develop really well-rounded skill sets. What’s something about organizing an event like this that people watching at home might not realize? Cam McCaul: Todd would be the right one to answer this in more detail, but from my perspective, it’s the village of passionate and dedicated people working around the clock to make wildly ambitious ideas possible. From Todd’s H5 Events to All Good Productions in NZ, to Rod Drury’s TRAC non-profit, the NZ Government’s tourism initiatives, the course builders at Elevate, the athlete advisory committee we have that consists of Cam Zink, Carson Storch, Casey Brown, and Emil Johansson, plus the whole crew I work with at Natural Selection who are simultaneously running events in 4 sports in the first 3 months of the year, it’s absolutely incredible what’s possible when you all feel like you’re doing it for the right reasons. I don’t think it’s possible to understand how much is going on behind the scenes until you get a peek behind the curtain. Were there any “oh sh*t” moments during planning where you thought something might not come together? Cam McCaul: For me, the biggest “oh shit” is realizing how many qualified athletes there are in our scene right now but how few spots there were on the invite list. That was the hardest part for me to be involved with. I’ve sworn I would never judge an event, but here I am on a panel of people who are selecting the invited riders, knowing that there are inevitably going to be so many I want there that won’t make it on the list. Being on a selection committee is almost worse than being a judge. Guess that’s what I get. If you could pick one rider from any era of MTB history to drop into this event, who would it be and why? Cam McCaul: Any era? Ok, Kirt Voreis circa 1999. Because he rules and always has. Some of the Natural Selection Bike Crew.\",\n",

       "  \"Photo Epic: 2025 McGazza Fest Dream Jam: MCGAZZA DREAM JAM 2025 Words and Photography // Riley McLay One of the hallmark events of the New Zealand summer has arrived, the McGazza Dream Jam. The highly anticipated event draws not only local riders but also a wave of overseas athletes who call Queenstown home during the off-season. It’s a continued celebration of Kelly McGarry’s enduring legacy that has inspired many riders of all ages to ride more and push their own progression. The idea of the McGazza Festival as a whole is to live a weekend like Kelly lived his life. Ride what he liked to ride, listen to the music he liked, and make the most of every moment just like he did. Whether you know of Kelly or not, the weekend gives riders the platform to elevate their skills and to learn from some of the best riders in the world while still keeping to Kelly’s relaxed outlook on life. The McGazza Dream Jam is a showcase of the culture that Kelly embodied and inspired. This year’s addition of an under 19’s category to open for the main event allowed the highly talented and up-and-coming groms to showcase what the future holds for the sport. The crowd was also treated to a star-studded main event with the likes of Jackson Goldstone, Laurie Greenland, and Asa Vermette. Not to mention, Kiwi free-riders Conor Mcfarlane and Robin Goomes were also throwing down. Next year marks 10 years since Kelly’s passing, and event organizers are already gearing up for a big one! A full trip down memory lane to showcase why Kelly is still such a special part of this community. Mcgazza Forever! Kelly still really inspires me. His attitude toward life and his willingness to help others and have the best time doing it makes me want to keep running this event for as long as\\xa0possible. — Emmerson\\xa0Wilken Celebrating the legacy of Kelly McGarry. Inspiring to see the next generation following in Kelly's legacy. Noah Evens boosting to the moon! Camden Rutherfurd showing that he is one of the most stylish up-and-coming riders. While having as much fun in the process. Imagine growing up with Dream Track in your backyard. Local ripper Reece Everett is no stranger to Dream Track. Throwing huge whips at only 14 years old. Watch the space, the groms are coming! A quick refresh before the adult's session. Jim Monro firing out of the gate. Jacob O'Donoghue-Price floating over the line up of riders. Tyler Brooker shining in all white. Asa Vermette in the house. Robin Goomes' huge backflip had the crowd on their feet. Conor Macfarlane with a head-turning dumped 360. You just can't teach style. Asa in full control. Rudi Eichhorn with one of the biggest backflips of the night. Gareth Burgess likes what he sees. Billy Spurway's trademark steeze. No complaints here. Flame on! Fritz fulling dumped, followed this up with a backflip Superman! Win some, lose most. Ollie Clements took a set of heavy bails throughout the night but kept getting back up and into his work. A quick Red Bull sales meeting as Asa and Jackson wait for their next run. Big ups to the Queenstown Mountain Bike Club and the Kelly Mcgarry Foundation for always putting on such a dialled event. Volunteers always bring the stoke. Plent of mouths to feed. Laurie Greenland with a steezy one-footer. Vinny Armstrong is very much a crowd favourite. There is always a chainsaw. Big smiles all round. Conor leading out the final McGazza train to end the night. McGazza Forever.\",\n",

       "  \"Videos: Adventures In North Wales with Hâf Land & Fleur TK: Haf Land and Fleur TK's North Wales Adventure Video by Samantha Saskia Dugon Photos by Sophie Skelton I'm Hâf Land, and I ride for Starling Cycles. I joined the family just over a year ago as a racer, and for 2025 I'm mixing this up a bit. Rather than competing, I'm going to focus on some adventures - big rides, fun stuff, and making some content. I'm excited! To get started, Fleur and I caught up for a local adventure in North Wales. She's a fellow Starling rider and one you've probably seen here in this video . We met up with filmmaker Samantha Saskia Dugon and also Sophie Skelton, who was capturing the day in pictures. The plan was to head out for the day and explore some of my local trails around Llanberis, in North Wales. I moved back here from Scotland a little while ago and have been really loving getting to know the place again, and wanted to show Fleur round. It was the perfect opportunity to shoot a video. We met bright and early (10 am!) and everyone was just super friendly. We all just got on great from the word go, which was a great start. We started off at a café to grab some coffee from a lovely yellow shop on the high street that matched Fleur’s bike! No coffee for me though - I’m Gen Z, so I don’t need it, according to Fleur, who is a Millennial and drinks a flat white. We set off up the hill with big smiles on our faces and butterflies in my tummy because I didn’t want anything to go wrong! We had an amazing time shooting this little project, and it was so great to have an all-female creative team—so much stoke! Sam was incredible and so well-organised with her filming, making the day stress-free and fun for all of us. Sophie recently moved up to Mid Wales and came along to take photos as she is developing different skills and techniques to use in her photography. Seeing her and Sam bouncing ideas off one another was so cool. Fleur is always absolutely awesome and drove all the way from Scotland that same morning just to see me! We filmed the day over four separate tracks and did a lot of pushing up through brash, which was less fun. But we ended up with some awesome footage and newfound inspiration for riding again. 2024 was a funny one for me, I started out racing really well, but had a bad-luck accident where I dropped a bike on my head and struggled with a concussion for months. I found it hard to be excited or inspired about riding for so long - but this adventure really brought back my love for riding. I had the best day and felt so at ease in the company of these three amazing women. As I’m sure we will see in the video, Fleur and I had a few tumbles! It was mostly on the same section of track, straight into the bushes! By some power of the universe, despite the high ratio of crashing to not crashing, Fleur, myself, and our bikes came out unscathed, bar a few scratches and a lot of laughter! No broken brake levers, PHEW! The trails in the area, although not many in number, rate very highly in my books. With some amazing craftsmanship on display, it’s clear that a lot of time and effort has gone into these tracks, and we were so grateful to be given permission to film there. The scenery was incredible, and we got so incredibly lucky with the weather—it was dreamy! After a long day of filming and dilly-dallying, we were so ready for another café break before calling it a day. We headed to an amazing local spot at the end of the lake, which I had been hyping up all day. We were all so ready for some nice hot food and drove there, only to find out it was closed. DEVASTATING. By this point, we were hanging. We were out of snacks, and just about keeping our eyes open. We called it quits and headed back to the café we had visited in the morning. We had something to drink and some cake (as all the hot food had sold out), then made our way back to the car park. After a long day of grafting, with three out of four of us having long drives back to various parts of the UK, we called it a day and headed home. And what a day it was! I’m super grateful to have been given this opportunity. I hope you all enjoy watching it! Expect to see more of this soon! CREDITS: This project was produced by an all-female crew.

       "  'Race Report: Crankworx Rotorua Ends with a Bang After New Courses & New Challenges: Crankworx Rotorua 2025 wrapped up with high-speed head-to-head action at the Specialized Dual Slalom, as athletes tackled a brand-new, repurposed Speed & Style course at Skyline Rotorua. The challenging terrain and uncertain bike choice made for an intense day of racing, pushing riders to their limits. Caroline Buchanan Takes Gold Over Jordy Scott In the women’s final, former Queen of Crankworx, Caroline Buchanan faced Jordy Scott in a dramatic battle. Scott held a 0.237-second advantage going into the second run, but Buchanan’s acceleration in the final flat section proved too strong, allowing her to clinch victory. Adding to her remarkable win, Buchanan was forced to race on an unfamiliar bike after her Dual Slalom bike was stolen just a week before arriving in Rotorua. “This course was so technical. Shark fin features that really threw a different element to the racing today”, Caroline Buchanan about the new course. The small final saw Pump Track Champion Sabina Košárková grab her second bronze medal of the festival, after also finishing third in the Pump Track Challenge earlier this week. In her first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom, Košárková defeated young Canadian Slopestyle standout Natasha Miller, who slipped on the final left-hand berm, sealing Košárková’s podium spot. Women’s Top 5: 1. Caroline Buchanan (AUS) 2. Jordy Scott (USA) 3. Sabina Košárková (CZE) 4. Natasha Miller (CAN) 5. Laura Smulders (NED) Ryan Gilchrist Defends 2024 Victory In a nail-biting gold medal battle against Sam Blenkinsop, Ryan Gilchrist emerged victorious despite a tricky first run where he nearly missed the final gates. Gilchrist came back strong, laying down the fastest time of the day at 19.961 seconds - a significant gap over the second-fastest run by Tuhoto-Ariki Pene (20.305s). With this, he secured back-to-back victories in Rotorua, defending his 2024 Specialized Dual Slalom gold and once again displayed his prowess and pedal power. Kiwi rider Sam Blenkinsop showcased that after several years of racing within the Crankworx circuit, he is still a force to be reckoned with and not to be counted out of the battle for the 2025 crown. In the bronze medal match, Gilchrist’s YETI teammate Richie Rude faced off against local hero and 2023 King of Crankworx, Tuhoto-Ariki Pene. Pene, in a dramatic turn, missed the final gates and was disqualified, awarding Rude with a bronze medal in his first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom. Men’s Podium: 1. Ryan Gilchrist (AUS) 2.

       "  'Event Report: The 2025 Slopestyle World Championship Kicks Off at Crankworx Rotorua: Full event replay Words: Crankworx The Maxxis Slopestyle in Memory of McGazza, the opening event of the Crankworx FMBA Slopestyle World Championship (SWC), delivered an electrifying showcase of progression and high-stakes competition under clear and calm skies. Originally scheduled for Sunday, the event was moved to this morning due to strong winds in the forecast. After extensive consultations and careful consideration of multiple scenarios, athletes unanimously opted for an electrifying new competition format: a high-stakes two-run elimination battle. This strategic shift not only raised the intensity but also gave all riders the opportunity to perform on the big stage of the SWC. For the men, the field was cut in half after Run 1, while the women’s competition saw the top five of eight riders advancing to a second round. Women’s Competition: A New Era Continues Now in only its second season within the Crankworx FMBA Slopestyle World Championship, the women’s competition reinforced that these athletes are pushing the limits and proving they belong on the world’s biggest stage. Germany’s Patricia Druwen made a powerful comeback from illness, throwing down an incredible 87.75-point run filled with technical mastery and precision. Her trick list included an X-Up to Suicide No Hander, a Double Oppo Bar Spin, and a Backflip Tuck No Hander, solidifying her place as a serious title contender this season. Joining Druwen in the final five were Natasha Miller, Robin Goomes, Shealen Reno, and Zoe Witwicki. Meanwhile, Renata Wiese and Natalia Niedzwiedz, competing in their first-ever SWC event, struggled with speed on the course and were eliminated after Run 1. The final runs saw Zoe Witwicki better her score but fall short of catching 2023 SWC Champion Shealen Reno, finishing fourth after missing speed into the whale tail. Meanwhile, Druwen, Miller, and Goomes celebrated their podium positions with a stylish party train down the course. Women’s Results: 1. Patricia Druwen (GER) – 87.75 pts 2. Natasha Miller (CAN) – 80.50 pts 3. Robin Goomes (NZL) – 75.25 pts 4. Shealen Reno (USA) – 67.50 pts 5. Zoe Witwicki (CAN) – 61.25 pts 6. Renata Wiese (CHI) – 35 pts 7 Natalia Niedzwiedz (POL) – 19 pts Men’s Competition: Tim Bringer Finally Takes Gold After eight podium finishes in the SWC, France’s Tim Bringer finally claimed his first-ever Crankworx FMBA Slopestyle World Championship victory, dominating the field with a 93.25-point run that left his competitors in the dust. Dropping in last, his 360 Double Tailwhip to Bar Spin, Double Backflip Tuck No Hander, and 360 Tuck No Hander In-Double Backflip Out solidified his spot at the top – an untouchable lead that no one could surpass in Run 2. The 2024 Red Bull Rookie of the Year, Kaidan Ingersoll (USA), proved his rising star status, bettering his score in Run 2 to secure silver with 90.87 points. Meanwhile, Canadian Ben Thompson, a last-minute entry after injuries in the field, made an immediate impact, earning bronze with an 82.92-point first run. The final round saw Paul Couderc, Griffin Paulson, Jake Atkinson, and Max Fredriksson advance, though Paulson, Atkinson, and Fredriksson all crashed on the final feature, much to the crowd’s amazement. Men’s Top 8 Results: 1. Tim Bringer (FRA) – 93.25 pts 2. Kaidan Ingersoll (USA) – 90.87 pts 3. Ben Thompson (CAN) – 82.92 pts 4. Paul Couderc (FRA) – 82.06 pts 5. Chance Moore (CAN) – 81.25 pts 6.

       "  \"Dario DiGiulio's 2025 Predictions: Behold, the visions of the seer. More radial tires. Schwalbe beat the competition to the punch with their radial tire release, but I don't think things will settle with that first release. The concept has legs, and the ride quality the tires offer seems to impress everyone that has a chance to ride them. As far as I understand it, the concept isn’t under patent protection, and can be iterated with various thread counts and casing approaches beyond the basic orientation change. I for one am stoked to see what the rubber wizards do with the idea over the next year or two. More downhill bikes. I think we’re going to see a few brands that historically haven’t offered a standalone downhill bike come to market with race bikes. My reasoning for this guess is as such: The DH World Cup is aiming to be a more premier and “important” series, with participants theoretically getting focused screen time and consistent results. That should encourage any brand with assets to spend to consider entering the ring, and offering their own ride for athletes to showcase. Add to that the supposedly democratized Continental series that the UCI has announced, and you’ll have a burgeoning market of aspiring racers looking for a solid race bike. DH bikes have never been a massive market, and of late if feels like most people are gravitating towards pedal-friendly machines, but this revised take on professional racing could stoke some competition on the brand end. Stronger brakes. The SRAM Mavens are the most powerful commonly available brakes on the market at this point, by some margin. Raw power isn’t the end-all be-all, but a high bar has been set for that one parameter, so I’d venture a guess that we’ll see more attempts at that accolade. Whether or not this is something you’re on the hunt for, I think the benefits come to light once you’ve had the chance to try something that can fundamentally change the way you approach braking, opening up new lines and speeds. Integrated complication. Last year I staked my claim on user-changeable frame stiffness being an increasingly common element on production bikes. While that didn’t catch on quite yet, I still think that’s on deck. I may be recycling from last year's list, but I still feel this one coming, so here's it is again.\",\n",

       "  'Event Report: The Inaugural Mt. Prevost DH Combine Invitational: Thank you to Stevie Smith Foundation, Municipality of North Cowichan, All-In Paramedic Services, all the pro riders, Aedan Skinner, Natalie Carrier, Oakley Salvisburg and all our volunteer course marshalls, and shuttle drivers for supporting the event and making it a success. Words by Holly Krasnuik and Darren Burns Photos by Jake Paddon and Natalie Carriere Video by Aedan Skinner What began years ago as a casual campfire chat between Canadian pro DH athletes McKay Vezina and Mark Wallace has now become a reality: Canada’s first-ever Downhill Mountain Bike Combine. The Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society in partnership with Stereo Racing hosted the first annual Downhill Mountain Bike Racing Combine Invitational on Mount Prevost in Duncan BC on November 1-3, 2024. Combines are a traditional method for teams and sports to find and develop new talent; which tests athletic skills such as speed, power, strength (mental and physical) and agility to identify future top players for the sport. The goal was to facilitate an event that would connect industry and unsigned U15-U17 Canadian riders in a meaningful, personal way that would result in a first hand learning experience about racing on the World Cup circuit. Parent participation was an integral portion of the event as we wanted to help facilitate an experience for supporting family members that helped garner awareness about the realistic expectations of what a professional career for their children encompasses. This year’s participants were 13 of BC’s fastest riders between the ages of 14 and 16 who have a goal of one day competing in the World Cup Circuit. These athletes were invited due to their performance at the 2024 BC/Canada Cups. The weekends events included: Friday: Meet and greet. Pro rider led Course inspection. Saturday: closed course practice on a taped course with 12 marshals on Mt.Prevost “Race Trail” Saturday evening: Q&A Panel with 8x industry professionals including UCI Team managers, nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist, Performance coach and pro athletes. Sunday: Timed training and race run It was great to see how excited the riders and their families were to be there this weekend. It shows the value of what we are trying to do and already has us thinking about next\\xa0year! — Mark\\xa0Wallace Working with Holly and Mark on the Prevost Combine was a real privilege. As a trail society, being able to provide a platform and a trail for an event like this to take place is extremely rewarding. Our hope is that the Prevost Combine created a stepping stone for these extremely talented and dedicated kids to be able to take their riding careers to the next level. It was a pleasure connecting with the participants, their families, and all the volunteers that contributed time to this unique\\xa0event. — Lorrie Mansey, CTSS Executive\\xa0Director About the organizers: The Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society was founded and incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 2013 and currently builds, maintains and advocates for excellent mountain biking and hiking trails in the Cowichan Valley; namely on Mt Prevost, Mt Tzouhalem, and Maple Mountain. With more than a decade of industry experience, Stereo Racing is dedicated to coming up with creative solutions to amplify and enhance the meaningful impact and sustainable development of mountain biking both locally and globally.  We are committed to cultivating a pathway for Canadian athletes, nurturing their talent, and fostering a culture that embodies the heart of mountain bike culture in Canada.

       "  'Bike Check: Lean Cycles P1 Prototype: BIKE CHECK Lean Cycles P1 Prototype Photography by TEBP In the beginning there was beer. Beer, bikes, two friends who were studying mechanical engineering and the will to design a bike unrestricted from commercial market demands. Robert and Luca were at the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW) when they had the idea to build a bike based on everything they had learned at university and their previous jobs. Luckily, their tutor was a bike nerd too and allowed Luca to make this bike his master\\'s thesis. The Lean Cycles P1 prototype is a wild mix of 3D printed steel parts, machined aluminum, welding, brazing, a progressive high pivot suspension design and - last but not least - a belt-driven gearbox. Robert and Luca founded a small company which enabled them to apply for research funding from Innosuisse. Their friend Kilian joined them later in the process, so Lean Cycles is now a team of three friends. From the beginning, they always wanted to create a bike with a very light rear end to reduce the unsprung mass. At the same time, a high progression suspension design was on the list too, which was designed around a coil shock. Thanks to the massive uni-piece swingarm, they don\\'t need a frame splitter to install the Gates belt. The geometry is full custom of course: - Reach: 480 mm - Stack: 635 mm - Wheelbase: 1272 mm - Seat angle: 77.5° - Head angle: 63° - Chain stays: 445 mm - BB height: 345 mm The goal was to push the boundaries of frame design to a new level using modern development and manufacturing processes, without being driven by commercial market\\xa0demands. — Luca from Lean\\xa0Cycles The tubing is Reynolds 931. Luca says that it\\'s really good for joining processes and double butted. It\\'s the same material as the 3D printed parts, which is needed to get the best results in his opinion. The machined swingarm is made from rather rare 2099 aluminum. Luca says that it contains quite a lot of copper and lithium, which makes it stiffer and even lighter than other aluminum alloys. It\\'s so rare that he had to get some help from his tutor to source it. It\\'s also around 10x more expensive than other alloys, so it wouldn\\'t be a viable option for a serial production bike. As this was a master\\'s thesis at a Swiss university, it wouldn\\'t have been enough to \"just\" make a frame. Of course there had to be a very analytical part too. To learn more about the strength of the welded and brazed parts, they made some mockups and put these in test machines. After that, Luca and Robert cut the joints open and inspected them with a microscope. This gave them valuable insights for the the welding and brazing processes for the actual frame. To make sure the frame would survive proper enduro riding, they got in touch with testing lab EFBE from Germany, which provided the team with data from its downhill testing program. All the calculations and assumptions they made are based on the EFBE DH test. For the 3D printed parts, they used topology optimization and the inputs they got from EFBE. It was a long(ish) process, as they did the calculations for every single part first and after that for the whole frame. The swingarm was also designed using topology optimization, that\\'s why it doesn\\'t look symmetrical. When all the calculations were done, FHNW did the machining and a partner company in Switzerland printed the other parts. The frame wouldn\\'t exist without Zurich framebuilding legend Wim Kolb, who helped them to weld and braze the frame and who also helped them a lot during the whole process. Brake levers from Oak Components. It\\'s not often that you see a stem that matches the dropper post. Funding from Innosuisse allowed the Lean Cycles team to get some 3D printed parts from a Swiss company. The lug is brazed at the seat tube and welded at the top tube. Luca hopes that the small grooves in the 3D printed parts can help to reduce stress concentrations. As this was the first bike they ever built, they tested their suspension design with Lego models first. No frame splitter needed on this bike to install the belt drive. How progressive? Yes. What will the future hold for Lean Cycles? One thing is for sure: They won\\'t sell this bike. Their main goal was to build their dream bike, to showcase their abilities and how modern technology can help to create outstanding bikes. Luca, Robert and Kilian from Lean Cycles would like to thank FHNW, Wim Kolb, Pinion, DT Swiss and Oak Components for their help.',\n",

       "  \"Review: MET Revo MIPS Helmet: MET Helmets have announced an all-new open face helmet, the Revo MIPS. It replaces the Roam helmet with a construction that offers improved ventilation over that predecessor. Highlights on this one include the impressively deep coverage at the rear, a good range of adjustment, and the quiet two-piece MIPS Air Node Liner. The Air Node liner deals with the rotational forces in an impact, while the polycarbonate-covered EPS takes care of more direct forces. On top of the obligatory CE, AZ/NZS and US safety certifications required to sell the helmet in those respective regions, the MET Revo MIPS conforms to the more recently introduced NTA safety standard required for Speed Pedelec, or e-bikes that provide assistance up to 45 km/h. Another stamp of approval for this helmet comes from independent helmet testers, Virginia Tech; a 5-Star rating is the highest rating possible, indicating that of the hundreds of helmets vying for your money, this is one of the safer options. MET Revo MIPS Details • MIPS Air Node Rotational Impact Protection • Magnetic Fidlock Buckle • In-mold Construction • Single Density EPS • 4-position adjustable visor • Cradle height adjustment • 23 vents • Actual Weight: 368 grams (Size S) • Sizes: S (52-56cm), M (56-58cm), L (58-61cm) • Price: 200,00 € / £169.99 / $230 USD / $300 CAD • Certifications: EN1078:2012 + A1:2012 and NTA 8776:2016-12 • Virginia Tech Rating: 5 Star (Score: 10.45) • met-helmets.com It isn't obligatory for MTB helmets, but MET is one of a growing number of helmet manufacturers (Specialized, POC, Fox, etc.) that choose to go above and beyond on that front; the NTA tests subject the helmet to multiple impacts over a greater area on the helmet, a little deeper on the shell than the standard testing. The Revo MIPS is a 5-Star rated helmet, receiving a score of 10.45 from Virginia Tech. The lower the score, the safer the helmet. A score of 10.45 puts it at #38 in the rankings, as compared to the 7.23 score of the current #1 , the Fox Speedframe Pro RS . Granted, the Speedframe Pro RS is considerably more expensive at $279 USD. However, it is worth highlighting that there are twelve mountain bike helmets that have received a lower (safer) score from Virginia Tech that come with a smaller price tag than the Revo MIPS. Performance & Construction The MET Revo MIPS has an in-mold construction with a single-density EPS. The coverage is notably very deep at the rear providing a little more than the Rogue Core helmet from sister brand Bluegrass. There are 23 vents distributed around the polycarbonate shell with deep ventilation channels visible on the inside leading to large exhaust vents at the rear. I won’t comment too much on how well ventilated a helmet is owing to my having a lot of hair, but I can tell you that MET go to great lengths to objectively test how cool their helmets are. Their in-house testing includes use of a wind tunnel and a head dummy heated to 38°C. By measuring changes in temperature of the dummy, the design engineers can determine what combination of vents and airflow channels delivers the best cooling effect. Inside we have a MIPS Air Node Liner, the function of which is to reduce concussive rotational forces during an impact. There are a multitude of MIPS liners, some of which can creak as they rub against the EPS shell. Happily, this Air Node variation is very quiet. It's also one of the lightest options going, combining the air pockets of the MIPS system with the comfort liner itself. On the Revo, the Air Node Liner is a two-piece affair. Due to the deep coverage a second liner was required for the occipital portion of the shell to ensure that the rotational impact protection adequately extends to that rear portion. RETENTION & ADJUSTMENTS My head circumference is 54cm putting me in the middle of the range of the size small I tested. While its features offer a good range of usable adjustment, for me, this is not the most comfortable and well-fitting helmet. I experienced pressure points at each side toward the rear of my head. I think the shape of the venting channels in this area narrows the helmet a bit. I prefer the fit of the Bluegrass Rogue Core which gives an even pressure everywhere. While the pressure points are evident initially I will say they aren't so prominent that I’m aware of them while riding. The head belt is a full wrap on the Revo so it tightens evenly when you cinch it down. It tightens from the back though so the smaller you make it the further the shell's position will be biased toward the front of your head. The dial on the cradle is a decent size so not too fiddly to adjust. The occipital height adjustment doesn't run on a ratchet system which is absolutely a good thing. In my experience those can slip when trails get rough resulting in the helmet's position shifting while riding, or while putting goggles on, requiring constant re-adjustment. With the more basic poppet design like that seen here on the Revo the retention system stays put. The visor has four indexed positions owing to an attachment point at the center that runs on a ratchet. It is reasonably flexible, designed to breakaway on impact to reduce rotational forces. That said, the fact that it is secured by three attachments instead of two likely means more force would be required before it broke away from the helmet body. Extremes of the visor position. Note: The Revo MIPS has a good range of occipital height adjustment. Here, I have it positioned with a rearward bias. I found the middle position to give a better fit, rotating the shell forward a little to give more coverage at the front. At the other end of the range, the front of the shell basically sits on my eyebrows. The MET Revo does offer storage for sunglasses though how secure it is will depend on the sunglasses themselves. The glasses I tested the helmet with don't have rubber on the arms for extra security so the glasses will bounce around and run the risk of falling out when riding over bumps. I guess helmet manufacturers could take matters into their own hands by providing rubber inserts against the wall of the ventilation channels to better grip the arms of the glasses. Importantly, the arms are able to slot all the way into the vents without contacting my head. PRICE At $230 USD, the MET Revo is one of the more expensive MIPS-equipped helmets that money can buy. I will mention again that there are twelve more affordable helmets ranked by Virginia Tech that have been award a lower (safer) score - like the $110 USD Specialized Tactic (Score: 8.55) which to my mind is still one of the best value mountain bike helmets money can buy. WEIGHT Claimed weight for the MET Revo MIPS in a size small is 370g; ours weighed in at 368 grams. That's fairly middle of the road, and on a par with the more expensive Fox Speedframe RS, Virginia Tech's top ranked MTB helmet, which gets the more advanced MIPS Integra Split. It's not particularly light, but with the deep coverage this helmet offers I wouldn't really expect it to be. Pros + Design prioritizes ventilation + Good range of usable adjustments + Space for sunglasses storage + No creaking + 5-Star Rating from Virginia Tech Cons - I experienced pressure points - There are lots of less expensive helmets with a better safety rating from Virginia Tech Pinkbike's Take The MET Revo Mips is a quality open-face helmet with a design that prioritizes ventilation. While its shape isn't the most comfortable for my head shape, the retention system does offer a good range of adjustment for dialing in the fit, and the sunglasses storage is a nice feature. While I am sure it will be a solid option for many, for me there isn't anything particularly standout about the Revo. It will be hard to justify purchasing this helmet over less expensive options that have performed better in independent safety tests. — Jessie-May\\xa0Morgan\",\n",

Tasmania aka Tassie, is Australia’s only island state and this rugged little island is filled with lush, dense forest and its reputation as a mountain biking hotspot has exploded over recent years, luring riders from all over the world. Maydena Bike Park is a gravity park with over 800m of elevation (most of any bike park in Australia) that officially opened in January 2018. It's located in Tasmania’s scenic Derwent Valley - an easy 1 hour and a 15-minute drive from Hobart CBD, or a 1 hour and 30-minute drive from Hobart airport. Jackson Goldstone giving The Local his signature 'tap' of approval. The Local is just one of close to 100 individual trails at Maydena Bike Park. It combines dense temperate rainforest vibes with epic, perfectly groomed jumps, rollers, and berms. Located on the lower slopes of the bike park, The Local can be accessed via a wide variety of technical, flow, or jump trails. There are two different uplift services, a fast turn around Lower Mountain ATV shuttle, and the Full Mountain shuttle bus service, taking in every metre of the parks immense 820m vertical elevation range... (be right back, going to look at flights). The park is closed during the [Southern Hemisphere's] Winter months and usually opens near the end of September. Long-travel trail bikes or DH rigs are recommended - there is a bike rental shop at the base if you don't want to travel with your own rig, along with a cafe & beer garden so you can have a break, grab a coffee, or chat over a beer and good food after a day of riding. Despite being the home of Red Bull Hardline in Australia, and having hosted multiple world-level gravity events, Maydena Bike Park also has one of Australia’s biggest networks of beginner-friendly flow trails - check out some of their recommendations . The Dirt Art team worked their magic to design and craft this place into a MTB Mecca and are well-known for their sustainable trail design methodologies, and construction. It’s not just flow and jump trails here, half the trails at Maydena are natural, hand built tech trails and each one is unique, making the options endless with each lap. The Local is a jump trail with pretty much everything including hips both ways, nice and wide and when dry it would run prime and even let you slow down a bit so you can get more pop. - Mitch\\xa0(hardinggrim) It's safe to say that Tassie is that like that quiet friend who lets everyone else brag, but deep down, it’s holding some of the best trails, the kind you’ll never stop thinking about.\",\n",

       "  'Review: Industry Nine Hydra 2 Hubs - 870 Points of Engagement & Increased Durability: Six years ago, Industry Nine blew minds with their release of the Hydra rear hub. They drew people in with unprecedented engagement, easy maintenance, and domestically-manufactured pedigree. Over the years though, the Hydra\\'s durability proved a weak point, and led to some premature failures and increased maintenance requirements over other simple hub designs. Industry Nine learned a lot from the many Hydras released into the world over the years, and integrated those lessons into the new Hydra 2 hub with a focus on durability and drag. Hydra 2 Details • 870 points of engagement, 0.41° • Increased durability throughout • Four axle standard options • J-bend or i9 spoke standards • 12 colors • Weight: 1710g, MX Enduro Carbon wheelset • Hubset Price: $700 USD • Wheelset Price: $995-$2,295 USD • industrynine.com Hydra 1 I was working at a shop when the Hydra was initially launched, and bought a rear hub soon after they were available, just to see how significantly they could change the ride experience. For technical climbing requiring finesse and careful pedal placement, they really did impress, with no detectable slop in the pedals as you hit the engagement point. After quickly getting used to the high engagement feeling, I came to enjoy it in the right circumstances, though it never felt like an absolute necessity. To this day, I\\'m still fine with standard 10° hubs, for the majority of riding scenarios. Over the years, my experience with the original Hydras soured a bit, due primarily to poor durability and the amount of drag they generate. I don\\'t have an accurate count, but I\\'ve personally broken a handful of axles in the rear hub, and have seen many more out in the wild. Industry Nine made a rolling change to the axle design in 2023, deleting the stress riser that seemed to be the genesis of most of those failures. Still, the overall design and bearing layout led to a fair bit of drag when tensioned in a frame, which does translate to some rolling speed out on the trails. Lots of hub manufacturers are honing in on drag as a negative variable in their updates, and Industry Nine is trying to tackle this in tandem with the durability improvements made to Hydra 2. The Updates Industry Nine gave the Hydras a complete makeover for their second iteration, with a revised layout and updated design that should increase durability on all fronts, while also improving some of the performance metrics. The engineering team at i9 says the changes to the design are as follows: • Rear axle update for increased strength, externally butted and 68% thicker than the outgoing design, with stress washer at the freehub to reduce loads. • Bearings utilize additional radial preload - same as with the Solix hubs - in order to reduce drag and increase bearing life. • Full contact outboard seals, to better protect internals from the outside environment. • Drive ring is 7% larger, and pawls now have 3 teeth each, in order to reduce the force between the two by 21%. The tooth depth is shallower, reducing the hub\\'s overall noise. • Larger pawl pockets to dissipate force more evenly and prevent elongation. Tougher metal on the drivering to prevent stripping or premature wear. • Hydra 2 has higher engagement (870 points / 0.41°) to reduce the flex required to engage multiple pawls. Less flex should yield higher durability. • Higher torque rating allows for use on Class 1 and Class 3 eMTBs. These updates are all unique to the Hydra 2 redesign, and won\\'t be backwards compatible to the Hydra 1 architecture. Those with the original hubs will have to pony up for a fresh set if the durability and drag improvements are of interest. One key element not laid out above is the brake-side bearing durability, which proved quite problematic on the original Hydra design. Specifically on the 6-bolt hubs, that outboard bearing would die a quick death in any sort of inclement weather, due to the proximity to the edge of the hub and general lack of sealing. The updated design places that bearing much further back in the hub, and allows for a larger seal to keep water and grime out of the area. Pricing & Availability Hydra 2 hubs will be available on their own, or built into a wide variety of Industry Nine wheelsets. Like all i9 hubs, the Hydra 2 can be purchased with either standard J-bend steel spokes (S-series, by their nomenclature), or with their proprietary System straight-pull aluminum spokes. There are wheelsets available with both options, with spoke count, axle spacing, and brake mounts available in a wide variety as well. I\\'ve been testing the Enduro Carbon System wheels, in a mixed 27.5/29\" set. As you can see below, Industry Nine is still offering the Hydra 2 in a bevy of axle standards, so just about everyone can feel included in the party. Performance I installed these wheels on my bike in late October last year, and they\\'ve been in service ever since. Four to five months isn\\'t enough to gauge true long term durability, but so far, the Hydra 2 has held up admirably well. Through a couple nasty months of winter riding, a fair bit of eMTB mileage, and no service whatsoever, they\\'ve proved unfazed. As a testament to their improved weather sealing, the factory grease is still clean in some areas of the hub internals, which often fouls up after only a few weeks of slop immersion. My list of damages is very short so far, with only one broken spoke to report. It cracked up at the nipple, and whether due to fatigue or an on-trail strike I can\\'t say - luckily it was easily replaced. Even if durability is slightly less than the steel alternative, there\\'s something unique about the ride characteristic of Industry Nine\\'s alloy spokes; the wheels feel taught, especially side to side. I liked the precise feel on long travel bikes through the winter months, but could see them feeling a bit pointy once trails dry up for good. If I were building a wheelset for bike park riding or general downhill performance, I\\'d lace the Hydras to a rim of choice with standard steel J-bend spokes. But for varied trail riding, and the right use case, the lighter, springier feel of the alloy spokes and i9\\'s carbon rim make for a lively package. On the hub front, there\\'s not too much to comment on besides the current state of durability (good!), the drag (less!), and the increased engagement (instant!). I\\'m not married to the concept of super high engagement hubs, but in the right circumstances they\\'re impressive . Southwest US-style ledgy climbing, where ratcheting the feet is paramount to success, tends to be the ideal use case, but anyone who likes weird tech climbs should appreciate the fidelity the Hydra 2\\'s offer. For folks who dig on chain devices or those riding gearbox bikes will probably appreciate the near-instant engagement as well, with the hub taking up any slack left by your fancy drivetrain additions. While some may love to hear their hubs screaming down the trail, I tend to prefer my wheels quiet. The Hydra 2 sound profile is a little less high-pitched than the original, but they still get pretty loud while coasting fast or back pedaling. I’ve found adding either Dumonde freehub oil or some Slickhoney grease cuts the noise down a bit, but it tends to only last about one ride or so. Again, most probably dig this feature - just my two cents. My last comment comes to drag, where the original Hydra was a serious offender. The Hydra 2 improves on this significantly, with the rear wheel spinning smoothly to a slow stop, even while clamped tight in various frame designs. There are definitely lower drag options out there, and I tend to prefer them for that little bit of extra coasting speed, but those hunting for maximum hub engagement should be happy with the balance struck in this redesign. Pros + Near-instant engagement, lower drag + Easy service, improved durability (so far) Cons - Still quite loud while coasting - Drag and complexity tradeoffs might not be worthwhile to those not hunting engagement Pinkbike\\'s Take Industry Nine\\'s Hydra 1 was favored for the very impressive engagement it offered, but fell behind the competition when it came to durability and coasting drag. Learning from years of feedback, it\\'s clear that the folks in Asheville have done their homework, improving the Hydra platform on all fronts for the second edition. Increased engagement is a convenient upside of improved durability, and the reduced drag simply adds to the list of upgrades. Though nearly instantaneous hub engagement isn\\'t something everybody seeks out, those who do are bound to be impressed by the Hydra 2. I wouldn\\'t call one winter a truly long-term test, but so far the hubs have proven reliable, and I\\'m looking forward to putting them through the wringer for the rest of the\\xa0year. — Dario\\xa0DiGiulio',\n",

Brage is quickly earning a reputation as one of the greatest freeride mountain bikers of all time, and films like this only reinforce that notion—going farther and deeper than anyone before to ride unfathomable lines in the remote Alaskan backcountry. Brage teamed up once again with Blur Media, a duo we've seen many times before and hope to keep seeing. This short film truly has it all: stunning visuals, jaw-dropping (pardon the pun) terrain, and Brage’s nonstop stoke. It’s a must-watch. Grab the popcorn, crack open a refreshment, and strap yourself in for 20 minutes of madness. Supported by Red Bull, Crown Mountain Guides, GT Bicycles, Fox Racing, Michelin, and Marzocchi Directed by Brage Vestavik and Herman Bøgeberg Filmed and Produced by BLUR Media (Herman Bøgeberg, Axel Rødningen, Oscar Kalsnes) Executive Producer - Mike Garceau FPV by Luke Bredar and Jonathon Chandler Edited by Herman Bøgeberg Color Grading by Axel Rødningen Sound Design by Herman Bøgeberg & Sebastien Uebbing Photography by Ale Di Lullo and Justin Befu Film Artwork by Memo Sandoval Music: “Sirkel” Performed by: Nifrost Courtesy of Dusktone “Clear II” Performed by: REZN “Mysterious Vanishing of Electra” Performed by: Anna Von Hausswolff “Ugly And Vengeful” Performed by: Anna Von Hausswolff “High Tide” Performed by: REZN “Ocean Dweller” Performed by: Bismarck Courtesy of Dark Essence Records “Echoes” Performed by: Bismarck Courtesy of Dark Essence Records “The Tree Of All Seeds” Performed by: Bismarck Courtesy of Dark Essence Records “Saturn’s Children” Performed by: Electric Wizard\",\n",

       "  'Transition Presents Blue Ribbon Trail Located on Galbraith Mountain in Bellingham, Washington: We are proud to present \"Blue Ribbon\", a public trail located on Galbraith Mountain in Bellingham, WA. This project is the culmination of years of permitting work, hours of machine time, and finished off by selfless volunteer work. Watch the video above to learn about how it came to be, and come visit us in Bellingham to catch a lap down this mind bending trail! Step 1: All trails require one thing, a corridor. To establish ours for this project we worked with local trail advocacy group, the WMBC, to obtain permits and find a window of time for construction. All said and done, this took nearly four years from when we kicked off the project proposal to when we broke ground. During that time we walked the proposed zone, looking for the right grade to create the flow we were after. With the planning and layout completed, the trail building mastermind, Nico Vink, arrived to start breaking ground. Step 2: Realize it\\'s too much work for one person and call your friends. We quickly realized it would be too much work for Nico so we called in TR GiddyUp ambassadors Teddy Jaramillo and Henry Lanman. They run a trail building operation in New Mexico, and were the perfect people to get on the job. Nico had always wanted to work with a crew of three and this project lined up perfect for that. Henry ran the big excavator clearing corridor and mining dirt while Teddy followed creating general shapes for Nico to finish and fine tune in his machine. Step 3: Dig \\'till you can\\'t dig anymore, then dig a little more. Nico, Henry and Ted were able to work for a solid month of spring, 2023, before the dirt became too dry to continue shaping. Nico then returned to Belgium to ride his bike and process the work he had already completed on Blue Ribbon. Giving him a summer to visualize the flow he had in mind for the trail. With some refreshed energy, he returned to Bellingham that Fall to complete the machine work on the trail. Countless days ensued with the help of WMBC\\'s Ryan Joslyn to create the final shapes that you can ride on Blue Ribbon today. Step 4: Find every available shovel and pair of hands to butter up the trail after the winter. With all the machine work in the past, it was time for us and the community to get our hands dirty and butter up the remaining bits of the trail. Nico had done almost 95% of the work with the machine, but a few transitions still needed some shaping. With the help of the community and a company dig day the trail took its final transformations and was ready to ride. Step 5: Open the trail to the world, and get some laps! After battling with some wacky Spring weather, we finally opened Blue Ribbon in June of 2024. Thanks to everyone who helped along the way and came out for the opening celebration. And a huge shout to Nico Vink for his relentless work and contributing to making this community better and better. This trail was a huge effort, and we are stoked to give it to the community. Hope to see you out there soon! You can find the trail HERE . Grab your friends and check it out this Fall!',\n",

       "  'Video: Adrien Loron Takes on Urban Riding in Barcelona in \"Salsa Brava\": Words: rideBiXS Barcelona has long been a hotspot for urban culture and street sports. Costa Brava serves as a mecca for BMX, inline skating, and scooters, while La Poma attracts dirt jumpers from around the globe during winter. Its unique urban architecture provides endless opportunities for creative riders. For Adrien Loron, Barcelona is more than just a destination—it’s a second home. Years ago, he and his friends would escape the cold by spending weeks riding the city. Now, Adrien spends half the year there, using the city’s countless staircases as his training ground for the Urban Downhill World Tour. This latest video project was a chance for Adrien to push his riding to the next level. His goal was to explore the urban environment in new ways, unlocking fresh lines and tackling unique spots. By switching between different bikes, he was able to make the most of each location and adapt to the challenges they presented. Years of exploring the city made scouting easier, but the project still demanded lots of creativity, precision, and courage. A wooden ramp, a couple of motivated friends, and a lot of determination were all it took to turn his ideas into reality. The pressure while riding these spots was real. In Cataluña, police patrols are constant, and riding in open public spaces isn’t always understood. You have to be quick—visualize the stunt, set up fast, and go. Sometimes, it’s a one-shot deal with no room for mistakes. Every spot has a story, and every shot feels like a\\xa0victory. — Adrien\\xa0Loron The project wasn’t without its challenges. Some of the wildest ideas didn’t pan out, but Adrien and his team still managed to capture unforgettable moments. This experience also deepened Adrien’s love for street riding, and he’s already planning more projects like this in the future. Special thanks to Adrien\\'s friends, without whom the video project could not have been realized: Pipe Vergara | Mati Rojas | Vitor Buchli',\n",
       "  'BC Bike Race Introduces New eMTB Categories For 2025 Event: Photo: Riders enjoy the trails at Maple Mountain in North Cowichan, BC, during the MegaVolt eMTB Festival, the first ebike event put on by BC Bike Race. PRESS RELEASE: BC Bike Race For the first time ever, the BC Bike Race has opened registration to e-bikers for the 2025 edition of the race. Remaining true to its roots as an innovator in the mountain bike events space, BCBR will be the first multi-day stage race in North America to launch an e-bike category. This follows on the heels of other international events, such as the Wines2Whales in South Africa and the Volcanic Epic in New Zealand. “This has been our minds for nearly 10 years since a few German racers asked us why we don’t have a category for eMTB. North America was then and still is about 10 years behind the European adoption of electric bikes. We believe it’s time to start including them in our\\xa0event.” — Andreas Hestler, Co-founder and Marketing Director for BC Bike\\xa0Race Dubbed the eBCBR, the new category will be open to both SL and full-power eMTBs and will run as a separate and concurrent event. This means the race will NOT mix electric and acoustic on the course at the same time and will create a schedule that gives both rider groups The Ultimate Singletrack Experience. There will also be an untimed option for those who want to ride the course without the pressure of a timing chip. The Journey to This Latest Evolution: BC Bike Race has always evolved alongside the Mountain Bike Industry. At our inception in 2007, the majority of bikes were aluminum hardtails with 26-inch wheels, and there wasn’t a dropper post in sight. Over time, carbon became the norm, full suspension took over, gear ratios grew, and good rubber started to hit the ground. As bikes evolved, the BCBR course has evolved, incorporating more singletrack and more technical terrain. BCBR gives racers the most, and arguably the best, singletrack of any stage race in the world. Now, there are eMountain Bikes. Embracing the history, growth and development of mountain biking, the BC Bike Race is evolving to give more people the chance to enjoy The Ultimate Singletrack Experience. More About the eBCBR: Date: June 30 – July 6th, 2025 Location: Vancouver Island – British Columbia Stage 1 – Victoria Stage 2 – Victoria Stage 3 – Cowichan Valley Stage 4 – Nanaimo Stage 5 – Cumberland Stage 6 – Campbell River Stage 7 – Cumberland BC Bike Race website Photo Credits : Dave Silver',\n",
